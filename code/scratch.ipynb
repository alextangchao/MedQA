High androgens Androgens are hormones that occur naturally in both women and men. Androgens are important for normal sexual development. In women, androgens are produced by the ovaries, the adrenal glands, and the placenta. In men, androgens are produced by the testicles. Normally, women produce small amounts of androgens. In women with PCOS, the ovaries produce high levels of androgens. Obesity Obesity is a medical condition in which a person has an abnormally high amount of body fat.

It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products such as medicines, vitamins, and supplements. People with celiac disease cannot eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine. Even a small amount of gluten can cause symptoms or intestinal damage. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease. The immune system mistakenly attacks healthy body tissue by mistake. In celiac disease, the immune response to gluten causes damage to the villi of the small intestine. Villi are small, fingerlike projections that line the small intestine. Villi normally absorb nutrients from food and pass them to the bloodstream. Gluten damages the villi, which prevents them from doing their job. As a result, the small intestine cannot absorb nutrients. This can lead to malnutrition. Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. Eating a glutenfree diet can help prevent symptoms and health problems of celiac disease. If you have celiac disease, your health care provider will give you a list of foods that you cannot eat and foods that are safe to eat. Reading food labels can help you identify ingredients that may contain gluten. Most food products made in the United States must have a label that says whether the food has gluten. If you follow a glutenfree diet, you can live a healthy life. Eating a wellbalanced diet is important. A dietitian specializes in helping people with food allergies and intolerances.

This condition is called a hemolytic anemia because it can cause red blood cells to break down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely. G6PD deficiency occurs in many parts of the world, particularly in areas where malaria (a parasitic disease) is common. The condition is most common in people of Mediterranean and African descent. In the United States, this disorder affects about 1 in 20 African Americans. G6PD deficiency is caused by mutations in the G6PD gene. The severity of the condition and the age at which signs and symptoms appear vary based on the genetic change. In people with G6PD deficiency, red blood cells are particularly susceptible to damage from certain substances in the environment (exogenous agents), such as drugs and fava beans. The signs and symptoms of G6PD deficiency vary widely and depend on the amount of enzyme activity that is retained in the body. People with the most severe form of G6PD deficiency, called the chronic hemolytic anemia form, have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) that begins in early infancy. The anemia can lead to pale skin, jaundice, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The anemia can be lifethreatening in some people, and it is often treated with blood transfusions. Many people with G6PD deficiency have a milder form of the disorder, called the acute hemolytic anemia form.

The LCT gene provides instructions for making the lactase enzyme. LCT is one of several genes that are located together in a region of chromosome 2 known as the lactose gene complex. LCT is the only gene in this complex that is expressed in the small intestine. The lactose gene complex is turned on (active) during fetal development, and the LCT gene is expressed throughout life. In people who are not lactose intolerant, the LCT gene is active (expression) in the small intestine from birth to adulthood. Lactase production declines with age in most people, but some people retain high levels of lactase into adulthood. This ability to digest lactose well throughout life is called lactase persistence. Lactose gene complex mutations that cause lactose intolerance are inherited from a person's mother. A mutation in the LCT gene that deletes the lactase gene's ability to produce lactase is inherited from a person's father. This mutation is called a polymorphism.

Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. The specific HLA gene variation involved in GPA increases the risk of developing the condition. However, most people with this genetic variation do not develop the condition. The HLADRB1 gene variation is also associated with a similar condition called microscopic polyangiitis. It is unclear how the genetic variation increases the risk of developing these conditions. The HLADRB1 gene variation may allow immune cells to recognize normal proteins as foreign, which triggers an abnormal immune response. This response damages the body's own tissues, leading to inflammation and blood vessel damage.\"}],\n",

Psoriatic arthritis usually begins between ages 30 and 50, but it can occur at any age. The disease often begins with pain and swelling of one or more joints and progressive damage to the joints. The most common symptoms of psoriatic arthritis are pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. In some cases, the inflammation may spread to the tissue that connects the bones or ligaments in the feet. This can cause the fingers and toes to become stiff and gnarled and pull away from the foot. Psoriatic arthritis may also affect the lower back, neck, chest, and joints of the hands and feet. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are linked to an increased risk of other serious medical conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Psoriatic arthritis can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to those of other forms of arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is sometimes mistaken for rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or reactive arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids to relieve pain and swelling. Other drugs, such as sulfasalazine, cyclosporine, and methotrexate, may be used to slow the progression of joint damage. If these drugs do not work, biologics may be used.'}],\n",

The virus is transmitted from person to person by the fecaloral route. The disease can be prevented by vaccination. The polio vaccine was first developed by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1955. The Salk vaccine is an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). The oral polio vaccine (OPV), developed by Dr. Albert Sabin, is a live virus vaccine. The Sabin vaccine has been used in the United States since 1963. The U.S. stopped using the Salk vaccine in 2000. The two vaccines are not identical, and some people may experience side effects from one that they did not have with the other. The U.S. currently uses a combination vaccine that contains both the polio vaccine and the diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus (DPT) vaccine. In 2000, the U.S. began using a DTaP (diphtheria, pertussis, and acellular tetanus) combination vaccine, which has less potential for side effects than the original DPT vaccine. The polio vaccine is also used in combination with the hepatitis B vaccine. The polio vaccine is given by injection in the Salk vaccine, and by mouth in the Sabin vaccine. The Salk vaccine is generally given in a series of four shots, while the Sabin vaccine is given in a series of three. Both vaccines are effective against all three strains of polio. The polio vaccine is given to children in the United States routinely as part of their vaccination schedule. It is also recommended for adults who have not received the vaccine, or have not received the full course of the vaccine.

A mutation in the CDKN1C gene disrupts the regulation of cell growth, leading to overgrowth of certain tissues and organs. The overgrowth seen in BeckwithWiedemann syndrome is caused by an increase in the number of cells (hyperplasia) rather than an increase in the size of cells (hypertrophy). The mechanism of this cell overgrowth is unclear. The signs and symptoms of BeckwithWiedemann syndrome can also be caused by certain chromosomal abnormalities involving the 11p15 region of the long (q) arm of chromosome 11. This region contains genes that are important for normal development. The most common abnormality is a deletion of genetic material from the 11p15 region. This deletion occurs most often when a person has an abnormal number of copies of chromosome 11 (trisomy 11p). People with trisomy 11p have three copies of chromosome 11 instead of the usual two copies. A small number of people with BeckwithWiedemann syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 11 in some of their cells (partial trisomy 11p).

It is used to treat eye infections, and sometimes it is used to prevent eye infections in people who have had previous eye infections. Ciprodac belongs to the family of drugs called fluoroquinolones. It works by stopping the bacteria from making more bacteria. Ciprodac comes as an eye drop to instill in the affected eye(s). It is usually used every 2 waking hours for 7 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use Ciprodac exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. To use the eye drops, follow these steps:  Wash your hands.  Tilt your head back and look upward.  Gently pull your lower eyelid away from the eye to form a pouch.  Place up to 2 drops inside the lower eyelid pouch.  Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eye for 1 to 2 minutes.  Try not to blink and do not rub the eye.  Wipe any excess liquid from your cheekbone with a tissue. If you are wearing contact lenses, remove them and do not put them back in until 10 minutes after you have used the eye drops. Wearing contact lenses while you are using Ciprodac may cause serious problems. After you apply the drops, blink frequently and press a finger to the tear duct of the eye for 1 or 2 minutes. This will keep the drops from draining through the tear duct and will keep your eye from drying out. If you wear contact lenses, ask your eye doctor if you should wear your lenses during treatment with Ciprodac. If you are wearing contact lenses and you also have an eye infection, you may need to wear a different pair of contact lenses, or you may need to leave your contact lenses out of your eyes for the rest of the time that you are using Ciprodac. You should not wear contact lenses that have not been prescribed for you by your eye doctor. If you have any questions about how to use Ciprodac, talk with your doctor, ophthalmologist, or pharmacist.'}],\n",

The labyrinth and the semicircular canals help maintain your body's sense of balance by detectinging changes in the position of your head.

In people with Emanuel syndrome, this translocation is present in every cell of the body.

During this process, chromosomes are normally meant to separate and recombine with other chromosomes. However, in people with Emanuel syndrome, one chromosome 11 and one chromosome 22 fail to separate and recombine with other chromosomes. Instead, a segment of chromosome 11 has traded places with a segment of chromosome 22 to form a der(22) translocation. If two egg or sperm cells containing a der(22) translocation join at conception, the resulting embryo will have two copies of the der(22) translocation in each cell.

In the United States, many states have child safety seat laws. These vary by state. They often require children to ride in the back seat and be in a car seat or booster seat until a certain age or size. Most car seats fit children from birth to 3 years of age. Some seats fit children up to 5 years of age. If you have more than one child, you may need two or more seats. Many children ride in car seats until they are 6 or 7 years old. Child safety seats are not the same as booster seats. A booster seat raises a child so the safety belt fits better. Children usually ride in a booster seat from about 5 years of age to 10 or 12 years of age. Proper Use Is Important Make sure you know how to properly use your child's car seat. Follow the directions carefully. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has information about how to use car seats.

OME can occur after the infection is gone. Nasal and/or sinus inflammation or infection. Allergic rhinitis. Cleft palate. Cystic fibrosis. The adenoid tonsillar area is the part of the upper throat that contains the adenoids and the tonsils. OME may occur when the adenoid tonsillar area is inflamed or infected. The adenoid tonsillar area is part of the immune system and helps fight infection. When it is inflamed or infected, it can cause nasal congestion and drainage. This can lead to OME. The most common cause of OME in children is adenoid tonsillar inflammation or infection. Children are more likely than adults to develop OME because their adenoid tonsillar areas are larger and more active. The adenoid tonsillar area can become enlarged during the winter and early spring when many upper respiratory infections occur. The adenoid tonsillar area usually shrinks by age 3. This helps explain why OME is more common in children than adults.'}],\n",

A person with sleep apnea usually has a few abnormal breathing patterns during sleep:  Pauses in breathing. These pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.  Abnormal breathing patterns. The person may take a normal breath and then breathe very slowly or shallowly.  Gasping or choking. These symptoms can disrupt sleep and prevent you from getting the rest you need. Overview Sleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that affects an estimated 22 million Americans. It can occur at any age, but is most common in middleaged adults. Overview There are three types of sleep apnea. The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. This occurs when your throat muscles relax. This causes soft tissue to block your airway during sleep. The other types are:  Central sleep apnea. This occurs when your brain doesn't send the proper signals to the muscles that control breathing.  Mixed sleep apnea. This is a combination of the two other types. Overview You are at greater risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history of sleep apnea. You are also at greater risk if you are over 40 or if you have a small airway. Small children also can have sleep apnea. Symptoms of sleep apnea include:  Pauses in breathing during sleep  Choking, gasping or loud snoring while asleep  Waking up with a dry mouth or sore throat  Morning headaches  Not feeling wellrested after a night's sleep  Memory problems, moodiness, or an inability to concentrate Symptoms of sleep apnea in children include:  Frequent wetting of the bed  Hyperactivity  Behavioral problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  Inability to gain weight Treatment for sleep apnea depends on the type of apnea and its severity.

Foods that are high in cholesterol include liver, egg yolks, foods made with high fat dairy products, such as cheese and butter, and fatty meats. However, the major cause of high blood cholesterol is the kind of fats you eat. Fatty foods raise your LDL cholesterol level. LDL cholesterol is the bad cholesterol that builds up in the walls of your arteries. This buildup is called plaque. Plaque can narrow your arteries or even block them.

You can prevent or delay high blood pressure by taking steps to control the things that affect blood pressure.  Overweight and Obesity Being overweight or obese increases your risk for high blood pressure. If you are overweight or obese, you can help prevent or delay high blood pressure by losing weight. Talk with your doctor about a reasonable weight loss plan.  Family History of High Blood Pressure Having a family history of high blood pressure increases your risk for developing high blood pressure. If you have a family history of high blood pressure, you can help prevent or delay high blood pressure by following a healthy lifestyle.  Diet High blood pressure tends to develop as you age; however, what you eat and how much you weigh also play a role in its development. Your diet affects your blood pressure in several ways. For example, a diet high in sodium can raise your blood pressure. The amount of sodium in your diet is linked to how much salt you eat. Too much sodium can cause your body to lose water, which increases the amount of fluid in your blood and raises your blood pressure. A diet high in potassium can help lower your blood pressure. Potassium helps your body get rid of sodium, which helps lower your blood pressure. Potassium also helps your kidneys work better. Your kidneys help regulate the amount of sodium and water in your body. A diet high in potassium helps lower your blood pressure by keeping your kidneys working better. A diet high in calcium can help lower your blood pressure. Calcium is a mineral that your body needs to keep your bones and teeth healthy. However, calcium also helps your blood vessels relax. When your blood vessels relax, your blood flows more easily through them, and your blood pressure goes down. A diet high in magnesium can help lower your blood pressure. Magnesium is a mineral that your body needs to help regulate blood sugar and blood pressure. Magnesium also helps your blood vessels relax. When your blood vessels relax, your blood flows more easily through them, and your blood pressure goes down.

There are two types of shingles (zoster) vaccine: zoster vaccine live (ZVL) and zoster vaccine recombinant (ZV-R). Zoster vaccine live (ZVL) is recommended for people ages 60 and older. The vaccine is given in a series of two doses, at least 4 weeks apart. Even though shingles is less common in older adults, having the shingles (zoster) vaccine can still help prevent the disease. Zoster vaccine live (ZVL) is also recommended for people ages 50 and older who have had chronic kidney disease for at least 5 years, or who have had an organ transplant. These people are at higher risk for getting shingles and having longterm pain after shingles. For people in these two groups, the vaccine is given in a single dose. Zoster vaccine recombinant (ZV R) is recommended for people ages 50 and older who have had chronic kidney disease for less than 5 years. For people in this group, the vaccine is given in a single dose. People ages 50 and older who have had an organ transplant should receive Zoster vaccine live (ZVL). The decision to receive shingles (zoster) vaccine is a personal decision. If you are age 60 or older, talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of getting shingles (zoster) vaccine. If you are age 50 or older and have had chronic kidney disease for at least 5 years or have had an organ transplant, talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of getting shingles (zoster) vaccine.

Others are diagnosed after a pregnancy loss. Outlook APS is a lifelong disorder. Some people who have APS have mild cases with few or no symptoms.

However, other blood thinners, such as heparin, may also be used. A blood thinner helps prevent blood clots from forming. The type of blood thinner used and the length of treatment depend on the severity of the condition and whether you have other health problems, such as heart disease, that require treatment. People who have APS and are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should talk with their health care provider about the best treatment options. Some pregnant women with APS may need to take a blood thinner during their pregnancy. However, blood thinners carry a risk of bleeding, so your health care provider will closely monitor you and your baby. Blood thinners also can be used to treat stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). If you have APS, you may need to take a blood thinner for the rest of your life.

It is an alternative to traditional open surgery for hip replacement, which involves a longer incision and more extensive soft tissue dissection. The goal of minimally invasive hip replacement is to reduce pain and recovery time, and to improve patient outcomes.\\n\\nHow is it performed?\\n\\nMinimally invasive hip replacement is typically performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes one or two small incisions, usually less than 4 inches long, over the hip joint. Specialized instruments are used to remove the damaged bone and cartilage and to place the new joint components. The new joint is then secured in place with screws or cement.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits?\\n\\nMinimally invasive hip replacement has several potential benefits, including:\\n\\n* Reduced pain and discomfort during and after surgery\\n* Shorter hospital stay\\n* Faster recovery time\\n* Better range of motion and mobility\\n* Improved cosmesis (appearance of the surgical scar)\\n\\nWhat are the risks?\\n\\nAs with any surgery, there are risks associated with minimally invasive hip replacement.

       " '\"Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and milk products. It is caused by a deficiency of lactase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose. Lactose intolerance is a common condition that affects about 65% of people worldwide. It is more common in people of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. These symptoms occur because lactose is not broken down and absorbed properly in the small intestine. Instead, it passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria, producing gas and other symptoms. There are several types of lactose intolerance, including primary lactose intolerance, secondary lactose intolerance, and congenital lactose intolerance. Primary lactose intolerance is the most common type and is caused by a decrease in the amount of lactase produced by the body. Secondary lactose intolerance can be caused by certain medical conditions or by taking certain medications. Congenital lactose intolerance is a rare condition that is present at birth and is caused by a genetic mutation. Treatment for lactose intolerance includes avoiding foods that contain lactose, such as milk and milk products. People with lactose intolerance may also need to take lactase supplements or use lactase-containing products, such as lactase enzyme drops or tablets, to help them digest lactose.\"\\n',\n",

Normally, the body produces an enzyme called lactase, which breaks down the lactose into two simpler forms of sugar called glucose and galactose. The glucose and galactose are then easily absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestine. If the body does not produce enough lactase, the undigested lactose travels to the colon (large intestine). The bacteria in the colon then begin to digest the lactose, producing large amounts of gas.

The disease is a complex, multifactorial condition that is characterized by a loss of central vision, which is caused by the death of photoreceptors in the macula. The macula is the central region of the retina, which is responsible for high-acuity, central vision. The disease is classified into two distinct phenotypes: dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD is the most common form of AMD and accounts for approximately 85% of all cases. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of drusen, which are yellow deposits that form beneath the retina. Wet AMD is a more aggressive form of the disease that is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels (neovascularization) beneath the retina.

Iron deficiency anemia can cause your child to feel tired, weak, short of breath, and irritable. It also can lead to learning problems. \\n\\nCauses of iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers include:\\n\\nNot eating enough iron-rich foods. Babies need iron-rich foods such as iron-fortified infant cereal, meat, poultry, fish, and beans. Toddlers need 7 milligrams (mg) of iron a day. It\\'s important to feed your child iron-rich foods at the same time as foods high in vitamin C, which helps the body absorb iron.\\n\\nStarting solid foods too early. Starting solid foods before your baby is 4 months old can increase the risk of iron deficiency anemia. This is because iron in formula or breast milk meets your baby\\'s needs until he\\'s 4 months old. If your baby is breastfed, he may not need iron-fortified cereal until he\\'s 6 months old. If your baby is formula-fed, you can start feeding him iron-fortified cereal when he\\'s 4 months old.\\n\\nHaving a diet low in iron. Your child may not be getting enough iron from his diet if he eats a lot of foods that are high in calcium, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt.

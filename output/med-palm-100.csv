What is (are) Glaucoma ?," Glaucoma is a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for carrying visual information from the eye to the brain.  The most common type of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which is often painless and has no early symptoms.  Other types of glaucoma include angle-closure glaucoma, which can cause sudden, severe pain and vision loss, and congenital glaucoma, which is present at birth. Some risk factors for glaucoma include: - Increasing age  - Family history of glaucoma  - High eye pressure  - Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease  - Certain medications, such as steroids  - Nearsightedness   Glaucoma can be diagnosed with a comprehensive eye exam, which includes measuring eye pressure, examining the optic nerve, and testing visual fields.  Treatment for glaucoma typically involves lowering eye pressure with eye drops, oral medications, laser surgery, or traditional surgery. Early detection and treatment can help preserve vision and prevent blindness.","Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. While glaucoma can strike anyone, the risk is much greater for people over 60. How Glaucoma Develops  There are several different types of glaucoma. Most of these involve the drainage system within the eye. At the front of the eye there is a small space called the anterior chamber. A clear fluid flows through this chamber and bathes and nourishes the nearby tissues. (Watch the video to learn more about glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) In glaucoma, for still unknown reasons, the fluid drains too slowly out of the eye. As the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye rises. Unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optic nerve and other parts of the eye and result in loss of vision. Open-angle Glaucoma The most common type of glaucoma is called open-angle glaucoma. In the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. When fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. If the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. However, there are treatments that may save remaining vision. That is why early diagnosis is important.  See this graphic for a quick overview of glaucoma,  including how many people it affects, whos at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more.  See a glossary of glaucoma terms."
What causes Glaucoma ?," Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for sending visual information from the eye to the brain. The most common type of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which is caused by a gradual increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), the pressure inside the eye.

IOP is normally regulated by the flow of aqueous humor, a clear fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye. In open-angle glaucoma, the drainage channels for aqueous humor become blocked or restricted, causing IOP to rise. This increased pressure can damage the optic nerve fibers, leading to vision loss if left untreated.

Other types of glaucoma include:

* **Angle-closure glaucoma:** This occurs when the iris, the colored part of the eye, blocks the drainage channels for aqueous humor. Angle-closure glaucoma can be acute, with a sudden onset of severe pain, vision loss, and nausea, or chronic, with a gradual increase in IOP.
* **Congenital glaucoma:** This is a rare form of glaucoma that is present at birth. It is caused by a developmental abnormality in the drainage channels for aqueous humor.
* **Secondary glaucoma:** This type of glaucoma is caused by another underlying medical condition, such as uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye), diabetes, or trauma to the eye.

Glaucoma is often a progressive disease, meaning that it can worsen over time if left untreated. It is important to have regular eye exams to detect glaucoma early on, when it is most easily treated.","Nearly 2.7 million people have glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Although anyone can get glaucoma, some people are at higher risk. They include - African-Americans over age 40  - everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos  - people with a family history of glaucoma. African-Americans over age 40 everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos people with a family history of glaucoma.  In addition to age, eye pressure is a risk factor. Whether you develop glaucoma depends on the level of pressure your optic nerve can tolerate without being damaged. This level is different for each person. Thats why a comprehensive dilated eye exam is very important. It can help your eye care professional determine what level of eye pressure is normal for you. Another risk factor for optic nerve damage relates to blood pressure. Thus, it is important to also make sure that your blood pressure is at a proper level for your body by working with your medical doctor.

What are the symptoms of Glaucoma ?," **Early glaucoma may have no noticeable symptoms.**

As the disease progresses, symptoms may include:

- Patchy blind spots in your peripheral (side) vision
- Loss of central vision
- Blurred vision
- Hazy vision
- Pain in your eyes
- Headaches
- Halos around lights
- Tunnel vision in advanced cases","Symptoms of Glaucoma  Glaucoma can develop in one or both eyes. The most common type of glaucoma, open-angle glaucoma, has no symptoms at first. It causes no pain, and vision seems normal. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains. Tests for Glaucoma Glaucoma is detected through a comprehensive eye exam that includes a visual acuity test, visual field test, dilated eye exam, tonometry, and pachymetry. (Watch the animated video to learn more about testing for glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.)  A visual acuity test uses an eye chart test to measure how well you see at various distances. A visual field test measures your side or peripheral vision. It helps your eye care professional tell if you have lost side vision, a sign of glaucoma. In a dilated eye exam, drops are placed in your eyes to widen, or dilate, the pupils. Your eye care professional uses a special magnifying lens to examine your retina and optic nerve for signs of damage and other eye problems. After the exam, your close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. In tonometry, an instrument measures the pressure inside the eye. Numbing drops may be applied to your eye for this test. With pachymetry,  a numbing drop is applied to your eye. Your eye care professional uses an ultrasonic wave instrument to measure the thickness of your cornea."
What are the treatments for Glaucoma ?," There are multiple treatments for glaucoma, depending on the type and severity of the condition. Here are some common treatments for glaucoma:

**1. Eye Drops:**
- Glaucoma eye drops are the most common treatment for glaucoma. They work by reducing the production of aqueous humor or increasing its outflow, thereby lowering intraocular pressure.
- Different types of eye drops include:
  - Prostaglandin analogs (e.g., latanoprost, travoprost)
  - Beta-blockers (e.g., timolol, betaxolol)
  - Alpha-2 agonists (e.g., brimonidine)
  - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., dorzolamide, brinzolamide)

**2. Laser Treatment:**
- Laser therapy is an alternative or supplementary treatment to eye drops. It involves using a laser to:
  - Create small drainage channels in the eye (trabeculectomy)
  - Enhance the flow of aqueous humor (iridotomy)
  - Reduce the production of aqueous humor (cyclophotocoagulation)

**3. Surgery:**
- If eye drops and laser therapy are not effective in lowering intraocular pressure, surgery may be necessary. Surgical options include:
  - Trabeculectomy: Creating a small drainage channel in the eye
  - Canaloplasty: Enlarging the natural drainage channels
  - Aqueous shunt: Implanting a device to drain aqueous humor
  - Glaucoma drainage implants: Inserting a small tube to drain aqueous humor

**4. Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS):**
- MIGS involves less invasive techniques than traditional glaucoma surgery. MIGS procedures are often performed in conjunction with cataract surgery. They aim to improve the drainage of aqueous humor without creating large incisions.

**5. Cyclodestructive Procedures:**
- These procedures involve destroying a portion of the ciliary body, which produces aqueous humor. They are usually reserved for advanced cases of glaucoma when other treatments have failed.

It's important to consult with an ophthalmologist to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific type and stage of glaucoma. Regular monitoring of intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage is crucial to manage glaucoma effectively and prevent vision loss.","Although open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured, it can usually be controlled. While treatments may save remaining vision, they do not improve sight already lost from glaucoma. The most common treatments for glaucoma are medication and surgery. Medications  Medications for glaucoma may be either in the form of eye drops or pills. Some drugs reduce pressure by slowing the flow of fluid into the eye. Others help to improve fluid drainage. (Watch the video to learn more about coping with glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) For most people with glaucoma, regular use of medications will control the increased fluid pressure. But, these drugs may stop working over time. Or, they may cause side effects. If a problem occurs, the eye care professional may select other drugs, change the dose, or suggest other ways to deal with the problem.  Read or listen to ways some patients are coping with glaucoma. Surgery Laser surgery is another treatment for glaucoma. During laser surgery, a strong beam of light is focused on the part of the anterior chamber where the fluid leaves the eye. This results in a series of small changes that makes it easier for fluid to exit the eye. Over time, the effect of laser surgery may wear off. Patients who have this form of surgery may need to keep taking glaucoma drugs. Researching Causes and Treatments Through studies in the laboratory and with patients, NEI is seeking better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with glaucoma. For example, researchers have discovered genes that could help explain how glaucoma damages the eye. NEI also is supporting studies to learn more about who is likely to get glaucoma, when to treat people who have increased eye pressure, and which treatment to use first."

What is (are) Glaucoma ?," Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for sending visual information from the eye to the brain. It is usually caused by increased pressure inside the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP). However, some people may have glaucoma with normal IOP.

The most common form of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which develops slowly and often has no noticeable symptoms in the early stages. However, as the condition progresses, it can cause peripheral (side) vision loss, eventually leading to blindness if left untreated.

Another type of glaucoma is angle-closure glaucoma, which occurs when the drainage angle of the eye becomes blocked, leading to a sudden increase in IOP and severe pain. This type of glaucoma requires immediate medical attention.

Glaucoma can also occur in children and is known as childhood glaucoma or congenital glaucoma. It is essential for children to receive prompt treatment for glaucoma to prevent permanent vision loss.

Overall, glaucoma is a serious eye condition that can lead to irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Regular eye exams and monitoring of IOP are crucial for early detection and management of glaucoma.",The optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibers.

How to prevent Glaucoma ?," While there is no cure for glaucoma, early detection and treatment can help slow the progression of the disease and prevent vision loss. Here are some tips to help prevent glaucoma:

-**Regular eye exams:** People over the age of 40, especially those with a family history of glaucoma, should have regular eye exams. These exams can help detect glaucoma in its early stages, when it is most treatable.

-**Control blood pressure:** High blood pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma. Keeping blood pressure under control can help reduce the risk of developing the disease.

-**Exercise regularly:** Exercise has been shown to lower blood pressure and improve overall health, which may help reduce the risk of glaucoma. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.

-**Eat a healthy diet:** A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including glaucoma.

-**Quit smoking:** Smoking is a major risk factor for glaucoma. Quitting smoking can help reduce the risk of developing the disease.

-**Protect your eyes:** Wear sunglasses when outdoors to protect your eyes from the sun's harmful UV rays. UV exposure has been linked to an increased risk of glaucoma.

-**Avoid eye injuries:** Wear protective eyewear when playing sports or doing activities that could put your eyes at risk of injury. Eye injuries can increase the risk of developing glaucoma.

-**Manage other health conditions:** Certain health conditions, such as diabetes and thyroid disease, can increase the risk of glaucoma. Managing these conditions can help reduce the risk of developing glaucoma.

-**Know your family history**: If you have a family history of glaucoma, talk to your doctor about your risk and what steps you can take to prevent the disease.

By following these tips, you can help prevent glaucoma and protect your vision.","At this time, we do not know how to prevent glaucoma. However, studies have shown that the early detection and treatment of glaucoma, before it causes major vision loss, is the best way to control the disease. So, if you fall into one of the higher risk groups for the disease, make sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every one to two years.  Get tips on finding an eye care professional. Learn what a comprehensive dilated eye exam involves."
What are the symptoms of Glaucoma ?," **Early-stage glaucoma often has no symptoms, which is why it's critical to have regular, complete eye exams.**

**Symptoms of中期和晚期青光眼may include:**

* **Patchy blind spots** in your peripheral (side) vision
* **Loss of central vision** (in advanced cases)
* **Blurred vision**
* **Pain in your eyes**
* **Headaches**
* **Nausea and vomiting** (in acute cases)
* **Seeing rainbow-colored halos around lights**

**If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to see an eye doctor right away.** Glaucoma is a serious condition, but it can be managed if it's caught early.","At first, open-angle glaucoma has no symptoms. It causes no pain. Vision seems normal. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains."
What are the treatments for Glaucoma ?," There are several treatment options for glaucoma, depending on the type and severity of the condition. The goal of treatment is to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Here are some common treatments for glaucoma:

**1. Eye drops:** Eye drops are often the first line of treatment for glaucoma. They contain medication that helps lower IOP. Some commonly used eye drops include prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and miotics.

**2. Laser therapy:** Laser therapy can be used to treat certain types of glaucoma. In laser trabeculoplasty, a laser is used to create tiny holes in the trabecular meshwork, which helps improve the drainage of aqueous humor and lower IOP. In laser iridotomy, a laser is used to create a small hole in the iris, which allows aqueous humor to flow more freely and reduce IOP.

**3. Surgery:** If eye drops and laser therapy are not effective in controlling IOP, surgery may be necessary. The most common type of glaucoma surgery is trabeculectomy, in which a small hole is created in the sclera (the white part of the eye) to allow aqueous humor to drain. Other surgical options include tube shunts, canaloplasty, and deep sclerectomy.

**4. Medication:** In some cases, oral medications may be prescribed to lower IOP. These medications can include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta-blockers, and alpha-agonists.

**5. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS):** MIGS is a newer approach that involves less invasive surgical techniques to lower IOP. MIGS procedures are typically performed through small incisions and may be combined with cataract surgery. Some examples of MIGS include Trabectome, iStent, and Kahook Dual Blade.

It's important to consult with an eye doctor to determine the best treatment option for your specific type and stage of glaucoma. Regular follow-up appointments and adherence to the prescribed treatment plan are crucial to managing glaucoma and preserving vision.","Yes. Immediate treatment for early stage, open-angle glaucoma can delay progression of the disease. That's why early diagnosis is very important. Glaucoma treatments include medicines, laser surgery, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these. While these treatments may save remaining vision, they do not improve sight already lost from glaucoma."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Glaucoma ?," There are several ongoing research and clinical trials investigating new treatments and therapies for glaucoma:

**1. Stem Cell Therapy**: Researchers are exploring the use of stem cells to regenerate damaged optic nerve tissue in glaucoma patients. Clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of stem cell transplantation in improving visual function and preventing further vision loss.

**2. Gene Therapy**: Gene therapy approaches aim to correct genetic defects or modulate gene expression to treat glaucoma. Clinical trials are assessing gene therapies that target specific genes involved in the disease process.

**3. Neuroprotection**: Neuroprotective therapies are designed to protect retinal ganglion cells from damage and degeneration. Clinical trials are evaluating drugs that can inhibit cell death pathways and preserve vision.

**4. Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgeries (MIGS)**: MIGS procedures involve less invasive surgical techniques compared to traditional glaucoma surgeries. Clinical trials are investigating the effectiveness and safety of various MIGS devices in lowering intraocular pressure.

**5. Drug Delivery Systems**: Research is focused on developing new drug delivery systems that can deliver medications directly to the eye, improving drug efficacy and reducing side effects. Clinical trials are evaluating different delivery methods, such as sustained-release implants and nanoparticles.

**6. Novel Pharmacological Treatments**: Ongoing research is exploring new drug targets and molecules that can effectively lower intraocular pressure and protect retinal ganglion cells. Clinical trials are assessing the safety and efficacy of these novel pharmacological agents.

**7. Biomarkers and Diagnostic Tools**: Researchers are investigating biomarkers and diagnostic techniques that can help in early detection, monitoring disease progression, and predicting treatment response in glaucoma. Clinical trials are evaluating the potential of biomarkers and imaging technologies for improved patient management.

**8. Telemedicine and Remote Monitoring**: Telemedicine platforms and remote monitoring devices are being developed to enable glaucoma patients to track their condition and communicate with healthcare providers remotely. Clinical trials are assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of telemedicine interventions in glaucoma management.

**9. Combination Therapies**: Some clinical trials are evaluating the effectiveness of combining different treatment approaches, such as MIGS with drug therapy, to achieve better outcomes in glaucoma management.

**10. Genetic Studies**: Ongoing genetic research aims to identify genetic risk factors and variations associated with glaucoma. Clinical trials may incorporate genetic testing to personalize treatment strategies based on individual genetic profiles.

These are just a few examples of the ongoing research and clinical trials in the field of glaucoma. The goal of these efforts is to find new and more effective treatments to prevent vision loss and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by glaucoma.","Through studies in the laboratory and with patients, the National Eye Institute is seeking better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with glaucoma.

What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,,"High blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures. What Is Blood Pressure? Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood. If your blood pressure rises and stays high over time, its called high blood pressure. High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. Types of High Blood Pressure There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure. - Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages.   - Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed. Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed. Measuring Blood Pressure Blood pressure is always given as two numbers, the systolic and diastolic pressures. Both are important. - Systolic Pressure  is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats.  -  Diastolic Pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats. Systolic Pressure  is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats.  Diastolic Pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats. Usually these numbers are written one above or before the other -- for example, 120/80 mmHg. The top, or first, number is the systolic and the bottom, or second number, is the diastolic. If your blood pressure is 120/80, you say that it is ""120 over 80."" Normal Blood Pressure Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range. Blood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults. Abnormal Blood Pressure Abnormal blood pressure is higher than 120/80 mmHg. If either your systolic or diastolic blood pressure is higher than normal (120/80) but not high enough to be considered high blood pressure (140/90), you have pre-hypertension. Pre-hypertension is a top number between 120 and 139 or a bottom number between 80 and 89 mmHg. For example, blood pressure readings of 138/82, 128/70, or 115/86 are all in the ""pre-hypertension"" range. (Click the table on the right to see the stages of high blood pressure in adults.) A systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher, is considered high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, your recommended blood pressure levels are a systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or lower, and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg or lower. Usually Has No Symptoms High blood pressure is often called ""the silent killer"" because it usually has no symptoms. Occasionally, headaches may occur. Some people may not find out they have high blood pressure until they have trouble with their heart, kidneys, or eyes. When high blood pressure is not diagnosed and treated, it can lead to other life-threatening conditions, including heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. It can also lead to vision changes or blindness. Possible Complications Over Time Over time, high blood pressure can cause - your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker, which can lead to heart failure.   - small bulges (aneurysms) to worsen in your blood vessels. Common locations for aneurysms are the aorta, which is the main artery from the heart; the arteries in your brain, legs, and intestines; and the artery leading to your spleen.  - blood vessels in your kidneys to narrow, which can cause kidney failure.  - blood vessels in your eyes to burst or bleed, which can cause vision changes and can result in blindness.   - arteries throughout your body to ""harden"" faster, especially those in your heart, brain, kidneys, and legs. This can cause a heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker, which can lead to heart failure. small bulges (aneurysms) to worsen in your blood vessels.

What causes High Blood Pressure ?," **1. Genetics:** Some people are more likely to develop high blood pressure because of their genes.
**2. Age:** The risk of high blood pressure increases as we get older. 
**3. Gender:** Men are more likely to develop high blood pressure than women before the age of 65, but after that, women are more likely to have it.
**4. Race:** Black people are more likely to develop high blood pressure than people of other races. 
**5. Weight:** Being overweight or obese increases the risk of high blood pressure.
**6. Physical inactivity:** Lack of regular physical activity can increase the risk of high blood pressure. 
**7. Diet:** Eating a diet high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium (salt) can contribute to high blood pressure.
**8. Smoking:** Smoking cigarettes damages the blood vessels and increases the risk of high blood pressure.
**9. Excessive alcohol intake:** Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure. 
**10. Stress:** Chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure.
**11. Certain medical conditions:** Kidney disease, diabetes, and thyroid problems can all contribute to high blood pressure.
**12. Certain medications:** Some medications, such as birth control pills, decongestants, and steroids, can cause high blood pressure.","Changes in Body Functions Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include -  kidney fluid and salt balances  -  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system   - the sympathetic nervous system activity   - blood vessel structure and function. kidney fluid and salt balances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system activity blood vessel structure and function. Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and eliminating potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure. Sympathetic Nervous System Activity The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure. Blood Vessel Structure and Function Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure. Genetic Causes High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure. However, known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3 percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes before birth also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life. Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including - high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity  - drinking too much alcohol  - lack of physical activity. high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity drinking too much alcohol lack of physical activity. Overweight and Obesity Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure. Medicines Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies (including birth control pills and estrogen) and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can - change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances  - cause your blood vessels to constrict  -  impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure.  change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances cause your blood vessels to constrict impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure. Other Causes Other causes of high blood pressure include medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. These conditions can change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure."
Who is at risk for High Blood Pressure? ?," Several factors can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure (hypertension). Here are some of the common risk factors:

**Age:** The risk of high blood pressure increases with age. It is more common in adults over the age of 40.

**Race:** African Americans are more likely to develop high blood pressure than people of other racial/ethnic groups.

**Family history:** Having a family history of high blood pressure increases your risk of developing it.

**Gender:** Men are more likely to have high blood pressure than women, especially before the age of 65. After the age of 65, the risk is similar for both genders.

**Weight:** Being overweight or obese increases the risk of high blood pressure.

**Physical inactivity:** A lack of regular physical activity can increase your risk of high blood pressure.

**Smoking:** Smoking cigarettes can damage the blood vessels and increase the risk of high blood pressure.

**Alcohol consumption:** Excessive alcohol consumption can raise blood pressure.

**Unhealthy diet:** A diet high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and low in potassium and fiber can increase the risk of high blood pressure.

**Certain medical conditions:** Certain medical conditions, such as kidney disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, and sleep apnea, can increase your risk of high blood pressure.

It's important to note that having one or more of these risk factors does not guarantee that you will develop high blood pressure. However, it is essential to be aware of your risk factors and take steps to manage them to help reduce your chances of developing the condition.","Not a Normal Part of Aging Nearly 1 in 3 American adults have high blood pressure. Many people get high blood pressure as they get older. However, getting high blood pressure is not a normal part of aging. There are things you can do to help keep your blood pressure normal, such as eating a healthy diet and getting more exercise. Risk Factors Anyone can develop high blood pressure. However, these factors can increase your risk for developing high blood pressure. -  age  - race or ethnicity  - being overweight  - gender  - lifestyle habits  - a family history of high blood pressure.  age race or ethnicity being overweight gender lifestyle habits a family history of high blood pressure. Age Blood pressure tends to rise with age. In fact, about 65 percent of Americans age 60 or older have high blood pressure. Race/Ethnicity High blood pressure is more common in African American adults than in Caucasian or Hispanic American adults. Compared with these ethnic groups, African Americans -  tend to get high blood pressure earlier in life  - often have higher blood pressure numbers  - are less likely to achieve target blood pressure goals with treatment. tend to get high blood pressure earlier in life often have higher blood pressure numbers are less likely to achieve target blood pressure goals with treatment. Overweight You are more likely to develop prehypertension or high blood pressure if youre overweight or obese. The terms overweight and obese refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. Gender Before age 55, men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure. After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop high blood pressure. Lifestyle Habits Unhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, and they include -  eating too much sodium or too little potassium   - lack of physical activity  - drinking too much alcohol  - smoking  - stress. eating too much sodium or too little potassium lack of physical activity drinking too much alcohol smoking stress. Family History A family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing prehypertension or high blood pressure. Some people have a high sensitivity to sodium and salt, which may increase their risk for high blood pressure and may run in families. Genetic causes of this condition are why family history is a risk factor for this condition."
How to prevent High Blood Pressure ?," Preventing high blood pressure (hypertension) is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular health. Here are some effective strategies to help you prevent high blood pressure:

1. **Healthy Diet**:
   - Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, found in processed foods, red meats, and fried foods.
   - Choose lean protein sources such as fish, poultry, and legumes.

2. **Regular Exercise**:
   - Engage in regular physical activity for at least 30 minutes most days of the week.
   - Include aerobic exercises (such as brisk walking, running, cycling) and resistance training.

3. **Weight Management**:
   - Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese increases your risk of high blood pressure.

4. **Limit Salt Intake**:
   - Reduce the amount of salt (sodium) in your diet. Aim for less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day.

5. **Quit Smoking**:
   - Smoking damages the blood vessels and increases blood pressure. Quitting smoking can significantly lower your risk of high blood pressure.

6. **Moderate Alcohol Consumption**:
   - Excessive alcohol consumption can raise blood pressure. Limit alcohol intake to moderate amounts: one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.

7. **Stress Management**:
   - Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Practice stress management techniques such as relaxation exercises, yoga, or meditation.

8. **Adequate Sleep**:
   - Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. Sleep deprivation can affect blood pressure regulation.

9. **Potassium-Rich Foods**:
   - Include potassium-rich foods in your diet, such as bananas, potatoes, leafy greens, and citrus fruits. Potassium helps balance the effects of sodium.

10. **Limit Caffeine Intake**:
    - Excessive caffeine consumption can temporarily raise blood pressure. Moderate your caffeine intake from coffee, tea, energy drinks, and chocolate.

11. **Regular Blood Pressure Monitoring**:
    - Have your blood pressure checked regularly, especially if you have a family history of high blood pressure. Early detection and management are essential.

12. **Medication (if prescribed)**:
    - If you have been diagnosed with prehypertension or hypertension, your doctor may prescribe medication to help control your blood pressure. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

By implementing these strategies and adopting a healthy lifestyle, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure and its associated complications. Remember to consult with your doctor or a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance.","Steps You Can Take You can take steps to prevent high blood pressure by adopting these healthy lifestyle habits. - Follow a healthy eating plan.   - Be physically active.   - Maintain a healthy weight.  - If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.   - Quit smoking.  - Learn to cope with and manage stress. Follow a healthy eating plan. Be physically active. Maintain a healthy weight. If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. Quit smoking. Learn to cope with and manage stress. Follow a Healthy Eating Plan Follow a healthy eating plan that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and whole grains, and that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat. Eating this way is even more effective when you also reduce your sodium (salt) intake and calories. One such eating plan is called DASH. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. This is the name of a study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health that showed that this kind of eating plan can help you prevent and control high blood pressure. The study also showed that combining this kind of eating plan with cutting back on salt in your diet is even more effective at lowering your blood pressure. To learn more about DASH, see  Lowering Your Blood Pressure with DASH. Lower Your Salt Intake In general, the lower your salt intake, the lower your blood pressure. Older adults should limit their sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams (mg) daily. The key to reducing the amount of salt we eat is making wise food choices. Only a small amount of the salt that we eat comes from the salt shaker, and only small amounts occur naturally in food. Most of the salt that we eat comes from processed foods -- for example, canned or processed meat, baked goods, certain cereals, soy sauce, and foods that contain seasoned salts, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and baking soda. Food from fast food restaurants, frozen foods, and canned foods also tend to be higher in sodium. See tips to reduce salt in your diet. Read Food Labels Be sure to read food labels to choose products lower in salt. Look for foods and seasonings that are labeled as low-salt or ""no added salt."" Look for the sodium content in milligrams and the Percent Daily Value. Aim for foods that are less than 5 percent of the Daily Value of sodium. Foods with 20 percent or more Daily Value of sodium are considered high. To learn more about reading nutrition labels, see  Reading the Label. Be Physically Active  Regular physical activity can lower high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time, spread throughout the week. (Watch the video to learn how exercise maintains healthy aging.

Maintain a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. Blood pressure rises as body weight increases. Losing even 10 pounds can lower blood pressure -- and it has the greatest effect for those who are overweight and already have hypertension. A useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI measures your weight in relation to your height.  See the BMI calculator to determine your body mass index  or talk to your health care provider. A BMI -  below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.   - between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range.  - between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.  - of 30 or more is considered obese. below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range. between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. of 30 or more is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit  Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, see Aim for a Healthy Weight.  If You Drink  Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks a day, and women should have no more than one drink a day. If you drink and would like tips on how to cut back, watch the video ""How To Cut Back on Your Drinking."" (To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) See how drinking alcohol can affect you as you age. Don't Smoke Smoking injures blood vessel walls and speeds up the process of hardening of the arteries. It increases your chances of stroke, heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and several forms of cancer. If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Once you quit, your risk of having a heart attack is reduced after the first year. So you have a lot to gain by quitting. See how to start a smoking quit plan geared to older adults."
What are the symptoms of High Blood Pressure ?," High blood pressure (hypertension) often has no symptoms. For this reason, it's important to have your blood pressure checked regularly.

In some cases, people with high blood pressure may experience:

• Severe headaches

• Vision problems

• Nosebleeds

• Nausea

• Vomiting

• Shortness of breath

• Seizures

• Coma

These symptoms usually occur when blood pressure is extremely high. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to seek medical attention immediately.","High blood pressure is often called the ""silent killer"" because you can have it for years without knowing it. The only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure measured. Complications When blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage the body and cause complications. Here are some of the common complications, along with their signs and symptoms. - Aneurysms.  These occur when an abnormal bulge forms in the wall of an artery. Aneurysms develop and grow for years without causing signs or symptoms until they rupture, grow large enough to press on nearby body parts, or block blood flow. The signs and symptoms that develop depend on the location of the aneurysm.  - Chronic Kidney Disease. This disease occurs when blood vessels narrow in the kidneys, possibly causing kidney failure.  - Cognitive Changes  Research shows that over time, higher blood pressure numbers can lead to cognitive changes. Signs and symptoms include memory loss, difficulty finding words, and losing focus during conversations.  - Eye Damage. This condition occurs when blood vessels in the eyes burst or bleed. Signs and symptoms include vision changes or blindness.  - Heart Attack. This occurs when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart doesnt get oxygen. The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain or discomfort, upper body discomfort, and shortness of breath.  - Heart Failure. This condition occurs when the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. Common signs and symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling tired; and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck.  - Peripheral Arterial Disease. This is a disease in which plaque builds up in leg arteries and affects blood flow in the legs. When people have symptoms, the most common are pain, cramping, numbness, aching, or heaviness in the legs, feet, and buttocks after walking or climbing stairs.  - Stroke. A stroke occurs when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a portion of the brain is blocked. The symptoms of a stroke include sudden onset of weakness; paralysis or numbness of the face, arms, or legs; trouble speaking or understanding speech; and trouble seeing.  Aneurysms.

How Blood Pressure Is Checked Your health care provider usually takes 23 readings at several medical appointments to diagnose high blood pressure. Based on the results of your blood pressure test, your health care provider will diagnose prehypertension or high blood pressure if your systolic or diastolic readings are consistently higher than 120/80 mmHg. Once your health care provider determines the severity of your blood pressure, he or she can order additional tests to determine if your blood pressure is due to other conditions or medicines or if you have primary high blood pressure. Health care providers can use this information to develop your treatment plan. Some people have white coat hypertension. This happens when blood pressure readings are only high when taken in a health care providers office compared with readings taken in any other location. Researchers believe stress, which can occur during the medical appointment, causes white coat hypertension. Preparing for the Test A blood pressure test is easy and painless and can be done in a health care providers office or clinic. To prepare for the test - dont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for 30 minutes prior to the test   - go to the bathroom before the test. A full bladder can change the reading   - sit for 5 minutes before the test. dont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for 30 minutes prior to the test go to the bathroom before the test. A full bladder can change the reading sit for 5 minutes before the test. To track blood pressure readings over a period of time, the health care provider may ask you to come into the office on different days and at different times to take your blood pressure. The health care provider also may ask you to check readings at home or at other locations that have blood pressure equipment and to keep a written log of all your results. Whenever you have an appointment with the health care provider, be sure to bring your log of blood pressure readings. Ask the doctor or nurse to tell you your blood pressure reading in numbers and to explain what the numbers mean. Write down your numbers or ask the doctor or nurse to write them down for you. Write Down Your Readings Ask the doctor or nurse to tell you your blood pressure reading in numbers and to explain what the numbers mean. Write down your numbers or ask the doctor or nurse to write them down for you. (The wallet card on the right can be printed out and used to record your blood pressure numbers.) Checking Your Own Blood Pressure You can also check your blood pressure at home with a home blood pressure measurement device or monitor. It is important that the blood pressure cuff fits you properly and that you understand how to use the monitor. A cuff that is too small, for example, can give you a reading that is higher than your actual blood pressure. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can help you check the cuff size and teach you how to use it correctly. You may also ask for their help in choosing the right blood pressure monitor for you. Blood pressure monitors can be bought at discount chain stores and drug stores. When you are taking your blood pressure at home, sit with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor. Rest your arm on a table at the level of your heart. After a Diagnosis If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor will prescribe treatment. Your blood pressure will be tested again to see how the treatment affects it. Once your blood pressure is under control, you'll still need treatment. ""Under control"" means that your blood pressure numbers are in the normal range. Your doctor will likely recommend routine blood pressure tests. He or she can tell you how often you should be tested. The sooner you find out about high blood pressure and treat it, the better. Early treatment may help you avoid problems such as heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. See tips for talking with your doctor after you receive a medical diagnosis."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,,"Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood. If your blood pressure rises and stays high over time, its called high blood pressure. High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,,"Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range. Blood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?," **High blood pressure**, also called hypertension, is a common cardiovascular condition in which the force exerted by the blood against the walls of arteries is consistently too high. This means the heart must work harder to pump blood through the arteries, which can eventually cause damage to the heart and blood vessels.

**Normal blood pressure** is considered to be below 120/80 mm Hg. If either of these numbers is consistently higher than 140/90 mm Hg, you are considered to have **high blood pressure**.

**Risk factors for high blood pressure include:**

* Age: The risk of high blood pressure increases as you get older.
* Race: African Americans are more likely to have high blood pressure than whites.
* Family history: If your parents or siblings have high blood pressure, you are more likely to develop it.
* Being overweight or obese: Extra weight can increase the pressure on your blood vessels.
* Physical inactivity: Lack of exercise can lead to high blood pressure.
* Smoking: Smoking can damage the walls of your arteries and increase your risk of high blood pressure.
* Excessive alcohol intake: Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure.
* Caffeine intake: Consuming large amounts of caffeine can temporarily increase blood pressure.
* Stress: Chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure.

**Symptoms of high blood pressure**

High blood pressure usually does not cause any symptoms. This is why it's important to have your blood pressure checked regularly, especially if you have any of the risk factors listed above.

**Complications of high blood pressure**

High blood pressure can lead to several serious complications, including:

* Heart disease: High blood pressure can damage the heart muscle and lead to heart failure.
* Stroke: High blood pressure can cause the arteries in the brain to burst or become blocked, leading to a stroke.
* Kidney disease: High blood pressure can damage the kidneys, leading to kidney failure.
* Eye disease: High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the eyes, leading to vision loss.
* Sexual dysfunction: High blood pressure can cause erectile dysfunction in men and decreased sexual desire in women.

**Treatment for high blood pressure**

The goal of high blood pressure treatment is to lower your blood pressure to a healthy level. This can be done with lifestyle changes, such as:

* Eating a healthy diet
* Exercising regularly
* Maintaining a healthy weight
* Quitting smoking
* Reducing alcohol intake
* Managing stress

If lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your blood pressure, you may need to take medication. There are several different types of medications available to treat high blood pressure. Your doctor will recommend the best medication for you based on your individual needs.","High blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures. There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure. Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,,"Abnormal blood pressure is higher than 120/80 mmHg. If either your systolic or diastolic blood pressure is higher than normal (120/80) but not high enough to be considered high blood pressure (140/90), you have pre-hypertension. Pre-hypertension is a top number between 120 and 139 or a bottom number between 80 and 89 mmHg. For example, blood pressure readings of 138/82, 128/70, or 115/86 are all in the ""pre-hypertension"" range. (Click the table on the right to see the stages of high blood pressure in adults.) The ranges in the table are blood pressure guides for adults who do not have any short-term serious illnesses. People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg."
How to prevent High Blood Pressure ?," Preventing high blood pressure (hypertension) involves adopting healthy lifestyle habits and managing certain risk factors. Here are some key steps to help you prevent high blood pressure:

**1. Maintain a Healthy Weight:**

How to diagnose High Blood Pressure ?," Diagnosing high blood pressure (hypertension) involves several steps and tests performed by a healthcare professional. Here's a general overview of the diagnostic process:

**1. Medical History**:
- The doctor will ask about your medical history, including any existing health conditions, medications you're taking, and your family history of hypertension.

**2. Physical Examination**:
- The doctor will check your blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. They will measure the pressure in both arms and take multiple readings to get an accurate measurement.
- They will also perform a general physical examination, checking for signs of hypertension-related complications, such as swelling in the ankles, feet, or hands.

**3. Blood Pressure Monitoring**:
- If your blood pressure is elevated during the initial measurement, the doctor may recommend additional blood pressure monitoring. This can involve home blood pressure monitoring, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (where a portable device measures your blood pressure throughout the day), or a 24-hour urine collection to check for protein levels (proteinuria).

**4. Laboratory Tests**:
- The doctor may order blood tests to evaluate your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and other factors that can contribute to high blood pressure.

**5. Imaging Tests**:
- In some cases, imaging tests such as an ultrasound of the kidneys or an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) may be recommended to assess the health of your kidneys, heart, and blood vessels.

**6. Differential Diagnosis**:
- The doctor may need to rule out other conditions that can cause high blood pressure, such as kidney disease, thyroid problems, or certain medications.

**7. Confirmation and Classification**:
- Based on the results of your blood pressure measurements and other tests, the doctor will confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and classify it according to the severity. The American Heart Association (AHA) classifies blood pressure into different categories:
  - Normal: Less than 120/80 mm Hg
  - Elevated: Systolic between 120-129 mm Hg and diastolic below 80 mm Hg
  - Stage 1 Hypertension: Systolic between 130-139 mm Hg or diastolic between 80-89 mm Hg
  - Stage 2 Hypertension: Systolic 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic 90 mm Hg or higher

**8. Treatment and Monitoring**:
- Once hypertension is diagnosed, your doctor will recommend appropriate treatment options and lifestyle changes to manage your blood pressure. Regular blood pressure monitoring will be essential to track your progress and adjust treatment as needed.

Remember that the diagnostic process may vary based on individual circumstances, and it's important to consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your blood pressure.","If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, here are questions to ask your doctor. -   Your Blood Pressure Numbers       - What is my blood pressure reading in numbers?    - What is my goal blood pressure?    - Is my blood pressure under adequate control?    - Is my systolic pressure too high (over 140)?

* Lose weight if you are overweight or obese
* Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
* Reduce your sodium intake
* Get regular exercise
* Limit alcohol intake
* Quit smoking
* Manage stress

**Medications:**

* There are a number of different medications that can be used to treat high blood pressure, including:
    * Diuretics
    * Beta-blockers
    * ACE inhibitors
    * ARBs
    * Calcium channel blockers
    * Alpha-blockers
    * Vasodilators

The type of medication that is best for you will depend on your individual needs. Your doctor will work with you to find the medication or combination of medications that is right for you.

**Other treatments:**

* In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat high blood pressure. This is typically only done when other treatments have not been successful.
* Aortic dissection is a rare but serious complication of high blood pressure. It occurs when the inner layer of the aorta (the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the body) tears and blood seeps into the wall of the aorta. Aortic dissection can be fatal if not treated promptly.","High blood pressure is treated with lifestyle changes and medicines. Treatment can help control blood pressure, but it will not cure high blood pressure, even if your blood pressure readings appear normal. If you stop treatment, your blood pressure and risk for related health problems will rise. For a healthy future, follow your treatment plan closely. Work with your health care team for lifelong blood pressure control."

These medicines work in different ways. Some lower blood pressure by removing extra fluid and salt from your body. Others affect blood pressure by slowing down the heartbeat, or by relaxing and widening blood vessels. Often, two or more drugs work better than one. Here are the types of medicines used to treat high blood pressure. -   Diuretics (water or fluid Pills)  flush excess sodium from your body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood and helps to lower your blood pressure. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.   -  Beta Blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. As a result, your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels, which can help to lower your blood pressure.  -  Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors. Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure.  -  Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure.  -  Calcium Channel Blockers keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower your blood pressure.   -  Alpha Blockers reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down.  -  Alpha-Beta Blockers reduce nerve impulses the same way alpha blockers do. However, like beta blockers, they also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down.  -  Central Acting Agents act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.  -  Vasodilators relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure.

How to prevent High Blood Pressure ?," Preventing high blood pressure (hypertension) is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular health. Here are some effective strategies to help you prevent high blood pressure:

1. **Healthy Diet**:
   - Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Limit your intake of processed foods, saturated and trans fats, sodium (salt), and added sugars.
   - Follow the Mediterranean diet or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which emphasize whole, unprocessed foods.

2. **Regular Exercise**:
   - Engage in regular aerobic exercises, such as walking, running, cycling, or swimming, for at least 30 minutes most days of the week.
   - Include strength training exercises at least twice a week.

3. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**:
   - Being overweight or obese increases your risk of high blood pressure. Aim for a healthy weight through a combination of balanced diet and regular exercise.

4. **Limit Alcohol Intake**:
   - Excessive alcohol consumption can raise blood pressure. Men should limit their daily alcohol intake to two drinks, and women to one drink.

5. **Quit Smoking**:
   - Smoking damages blood vessels and increases your risk of high blood pressure. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your cardiovascular health.

6. **Manage Stress**:
   - Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or hobbies that you enjoy.

7. **Reduce Caffeine Intake**:
   - Excessive caffeine consumption can temporarily raise blood pressure. Limit your intake of caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea, and energy drinks.

8. **Monitor Blood Pressure**:
   - Regularly check your blood pressure, especially if you have a family history of hypertension or if you're over 40 years of age. Home blood pressure monitors are readily available and easy to use.

9. **Adequate Sleep**:
   - Getting enough restful sleep (around 7-8 hours per night) is important for overall health, including blood pressure regulation.

10. **Limit Sodium Intake**:
    - Reduce your daily sodium intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt). Avoid processed and prepackaged foods that are high in sodium.

11. **Potassium-Rich Foods**:
    - Consume potassium-rich foods, such as bananas, oranges, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes, as potassium helps counteract the effects of sodium.

12. **Limit Saturated and Trans Fats**:
    - Replace saturated and trans fats (found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods) with healthier unsaturated fats, such as those found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts.

Remember that preventing high blood pressure often involves lifestyle modifications. It's important to make gradual changes and consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have other underlying health conditions or concerns.","Two key measures are used to determine if someone is overweight or obese. These are body mass index, or BMI, and waist circumference. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of weight in relation to height, and provides an estimate of your total body fat. As your BMI goes up, so do your chances of getting high blood pressure, heart disease, and other health problems. A BMI -  below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.  - between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range.  - between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.  - of 30 or more is considered obese.  below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range. between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. of 30 or more is considered obese. See the Body Mass Index Table, available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Body mass index (BMI) applies to both men and women, but it does have some limits. - It may overestimate body fat in in someone who is very muscular or who has swelling from fluid retention (called edema)  - It may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle mass. It may overestimate body fat in in someone who is very muscular or who has swelling from fluid retention (called edema) It may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle mass. Thats why waist measurement is often checked as well. Another reason is that too much body fat in the stomach area also increases disease risk. A waist measurement of more than 35 inches in women and more than 40 inches in men is considered high."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?," **High blood pressure**, also called hypertension, is a condition in which the force of blood against the walls of your arteries is too high. As a result, the heart must work harder to pump blood throughout the body, which can lead to heart problems, kidney disease, stroke, and other health issues.

**There are two types of high blood pressure**:

1. **Primary (essential) hypertension** is the most common type. It develops over time and usually has no identifiable cause.
2. **Secondary hypertension** is caused by an underlying medical condition, such as kidney disease, thyroid problems, or certain medications.

**Risk factors for high blood pressure** include:

* **Age:** High blood pressure is more common in people over the age of 65.
* **Race:** African Americans are more likely to develop high blood pressure than people of other races.
* **Gender:** Men are more likely to develop high blood pressure than women.
* **Family history:** Having a family history of high blood pressure increases your risk of developing the condition.
* **Weight:** Being overweight or obese increases your risk of high blood pressure.
* **Physical inactivity:** People who are physically inactive are more likely to develop high blood pressure.
* **Smoking:** Smoking cigarettes increases your risk of high blood pressure.
* **Alcohol intake:** Drinking too much alcohol can increase your risk of high blood pressure.
* **Stress:** Chronic stress can increase your risk of high blood pressure.

**Symptoms of high blood pressure** can include:

* Headaches
* Nosebleeds
* Fatigue
* Blurred vision
* Chest pain
* Shortness of breath
* Dizziness
* Nausea and vomiting

**High blood pressure is a serious condition that can lead to life-threatening complications if not treated. If you have any of the symptoms of high blood pressure, see your doctor immediately.**

**Treatment for high blood pressure** may include:

* **Lifestyle changes:** Making healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, reducing stress, and limiting alcohol intake, can help lower blood pressure.
* **Medications:** Medications may be prescribed to lower blood pressure. These medications can include diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers.","Blood pressure rises as body weight increases. Losing even 10 pounds can lower blood pressure -- and it has the greatest effect for those who are overweight and already have hypertension. If you are overweight or obese, work with your health care provider to develop a plan to help you lower your weight and maintain a healthy weight. Aim to reduce your weight by 7 to 10 percent over six months, which can lower your risk for health problems. For example, if you are overweight at 200 pounds, try to lose 14 to 20 pounds over six months. After that, you may have to continue to lose weight to get to a healthy weight."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,,"""DASH"" stands for ""Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension."" This is the name of a clinical study that tested the effects of nutrients in food on blood pressure. Study results indicated that you can reduce high blood pressure by following an eating plan that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, total fat, and added sugars. The DASH eating plan also includes whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, and has reduced amounts of red meats, sweets, added sugars, and beverages containing sugars. A second study, called ""DASH-Sodium,"" showed that eating less salt also lowered blood pressure in people following either the DASH eating plan or the typical American diet. But those following DASH, especially those with high blood pressure, benefited the most. For more information on using the DASH eating plan, see  Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure with DASH."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,,"Only a small amount of the salt that we eat comes from the salt shaker, and only small amounts occur naturally in food. Most of the salt that we eat comes from processed foods -- for example, canned or processed meat, baked goods, and certain cereals, and foods with soy sauce, seasoned salts, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and baking soda. Food from fast food restaurants, frozen foods, and canned foods also tend to be higher in sodium."

What is (are) Paget's Disease of Bone ?," **Paget's Disease of Bone (PDB)**, also known as osteitis deformans, is a chronic bone disorder characterized by excessive bone growth and remodeling. It is a relatively common condition affecting approximately 1-3% of the population over the age of 40, with a higher prevalence among older individuals. PDB typically affects multiple bones, most commonly the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones of the legs and arms.

**Key features of Paget's Disease of Bone:**

1. **Abnormal Bone Remodeling:** In PDB, the normal bone remodeling process is disrupted, leading to excessive bone resorption (breakdown) followed by disorganized bone formation. This results in the formation of thicker, weaker, and deformed bones.

2. **Mosaic Pattern:** PDB affects only certain areas within a bone, creating a mosaic pattern of affected and unaffected bone tissue. The affected areas may appear mottled or thickened on imaging studies, such as X-rays.

3. **Bone Pain and Deformities:** PDB can cause bone pain, especially in the affected areas. As the disease progresses, it may lead to bone deformities, such as bowing of the legs, enlargement of the skull, or flattening of the vertebrae.

4. **Fractures and Complications:** The weakened bones in PDB are more susceptible to fractures, which can occur even with minor trauma. Other potential complications include arthritis in the affected joints, nerve compression due to bone enlargement, and hearing loss if the skull is involved.

5. **Increased Risk of Osteosarcoma:** Although rare, individuals with PDB have a slightly higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, in the affected bones. However, the overall incidence of osteosarcoma in PDB patients remains low.

The exact cause of Paget's Disease of Bone is not fully understood, but genetic factors and environmental influences are believed to play a role. It is commonly managed through medication to control bone turnover, reduce pain, and prevent complications. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can help slow the progression of the disease and minimize its impact on bone health.","Enlarged and Misshapen Bones Paget's disease of bone causes affected bones to become enlarged and misshapen. Our bones are living tissue, and our bodies are constantly breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone. In Paget's disease, however, old bone is broken down and replaced at a faster rate than normal. The new bone is larger and weaker than normal bone. Paget's disease can occur in any bone in the body, but it is most common in the pelvis, spine, skull, and leg bones. It may occur in just one bone or in several bones, but it does not affect the entire skeleton or spread from affected bones to normal bones. Common symptoms include pain, misshapen bones, and a greater chance of broken bones. Complications Paget's disease can also lead to complications, such as arthritis, headaches, hearing loss, or nervous system problems, depending on which bones are affected. If not treated, Paget's disease can reduce a person's ability to perform activities of daily living, thereby reducing quality of life. Although it is the second most common bone disease after osteoporosis, Paget's disease is still uncommon. According to Bone Health and Osteoporosis: A Report of the Surgeon General, an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. have Paget's disease, or about 1.3 people per 100 men and women age 45-74. The disease is more common in older people and those of Northern European heritage. Men are more likely than women to have the disease. Cause is Unknown Paget's disease is named after the British surgeon, Sir James Paget, who first identified the disease in 1877. Researchers are not sure what causes it. Heredity may be a factor in some cases. Research suggests that a close relative of someone with Paget's disease is seven times more likely to develop the disease than someone without an affected relative. However, most people with Paget's disease do not have any relatives with the disease. Researchers think the disease also may be caused by other factors, such as a slow-acting virus. A Treatable Disease The good news is that Paget's disease of bone is treatable, especially if it is diagnosed early. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow the disease's progression. In some cases, surgery can help patients manage the symptoms and complications of the disease."
What are the symptoms of Paget's Disease of Bone ?," The signs and symptoms of Paget's disease of bone vary depending on the location and severity of the affected bones. Some people may not experience any symptoms and the condition may only be discovered during a routine X-ray or examination for an unrelated condition. In others, the symptoms can be mild or severe and may include:

**1. Bone pain:** Pain is a common symptom of Paget's disease and may be described as dull, aching, or throbbing. It can occur in any bone affected by the disease, but is most commonly felt in the legs, pelvis, spine, or skull.

**2. Enlargement of bones:** Affected bones may become enlarged and thickened. This can be noticeable in the skull, where it can lead to an increase in head size, or in the legs, where it can cause bowing of the bones.

**3. Deformities:** The enlargement and softening of bones can lead to deformities, such as bowing of the legs, curvature of the spine, or a hunched posture.

**4. Fractures:** Weakened bones are more prone to fractures, which can occur even with minor trauma. Fractures may be more common in the hip, pelvis, or spine.

**5. Hearing loss:** Paget's disease can affect the bone surrounding the inner ear, leading to hearing loss.

**6. Headache:** If the skull is affected by Paget's disease, it can cause headaches.

**7. Joint pain:** The enlargement of bones can put pressure on nearby joints, leading to joint pain and stiffness.

**8. Fatigue and weakness:** Some people with Paget's disease may experience fatigue and general weakness.

**9. Bone overgrowth:** In some cases, excessive bone growth can put pressure on nerves or blood vessels, causing pain, tingling, or numbness.

It's worth noting that not all people with Paget's disease experience these symptoms. Some individuals may have mild or even no symptoms throughout the course of the disease. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management.","Symptoms Many people don't know they have Paget's disease because they have a mild case of the disease and do not have any symptoms. However, people with more advanced cases of the disease will likely have symptoms. Symptoms vary depending on which bone or bones are affected. People with Paget's disease may experience - bone pain  - misshapen bones  - fractures  - osteoarthritis of the joints adjacent to bone affected by the disease.  bone pain misshapen bones fractures osteoarthritis of the joints adjacent to bone affected by the disease. Paget's disease can also cause a variety of neurological complications as a result of compression of nerve tissue by bone affected by the disease. Misshapen bone is most obvious when the leg bones, skull, or bones of the spine are affected. Leg bones may become bowed, the skull may become enlarged, and malformed spinal bones may cause curvature of the spine. Complications People with Paget's disease also are more likely to break bones because bones affected by the disease are more fragile. Enlarged and malformed bones can distort the position of bones and joints. This causes wear and tear on the joints next to bones affected by Paget's disease, resulting in arthritis. On very rare occasions, Paget's disease is linked to the development of osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. Less than one percent of patients have this complication."
How to diagnose Paget's Disease of Bone ?," **Diagnosis of Paget's disease of bone (PDB) involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Here's a general approach to diagnosing PDB:**

1. **Medical History and Physical Examination:**
   - The doctor will ask about symptoms, such as bone pain, deformity, or enlargement.
   - A physical examination may reveal tenderness, swelling, or deformities in the affected bone(s).

2. **Laboratory Tests:**
   - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test: Elevated ALP levels are commonly seen in PDB.
   - Calcium and phosphate levels: These may be abnormal in some cases of PDB.

3. **Imaging Studies:**
   - X-rays: These can show characteristic changes in the affected bone(s), such as thickening, coarsening, and deformities.
   - Bone scan: A bone scan using a radioactive tracer can reveal areas of increased bone turnover, which may indicate PDB.
   - Computed tomography (CT) scan: CT scans provide detailed cross-sectional images of the bones and can help assess the extent of the disease.
   - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: MRI scans can provide additional information about the soft tissues surrounding the affected bone(s).

4. **Bone Biopsy:**
   - In some cases, a bone biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PDB. This involves taking a small sample of bone tissue for examination under a microscope.

5. **Additional Tests:**
   - Urine and blood tests may be done to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.
   - Genetic testing may be performed in certain cases to identify specific genetic mutations associated with PDB.

**It's important to note that PDB can sometimes be challenging to diagnose, especially in its early stages. Diagnosis may involve a multidisciplinary approach with input from specialists in bone diseases (orthopedists, endocrinologists, or rheumatologists), radiologists, and pathologists.**","An Underdiagnosed Disease Experts believe that Paget's disease is underdiagnosed; people with a mild case and no symptoms may never know they have the disease. Or, they may receive a diagnosis by accident when x-rays or other laboratory tests done for another reason reveal Paget's disease. When symptoms do occur, they usually appear gradually and, in the early stages, may be confused with those of arthritis or other medical problems. Sometimes a person may not receive a clear diagnosis until the disease progresses and complications develop. Diagnostic Tests X-rays are almost always used to diagnose Paget's disease, but the disease may be discovered using one of three tests: - x-rays  -  an alkaline phosphatase blood test  -  or a bone scan. x-rays an alkaline phosphatase blood test or a bone scan. Bones affected by Paget's disease have a distinctive appearance on x-rays, which may show increased bone density, an abnormal bone structure, bowing, and enlargement. X-rays of leg bones may show very tiny fractures called microfractures. The enzyme alkaline phosphatase is involved in the normal growth of new bone. Having higher-than-normal levels of this chemical in the blood, however, may be a sign of Paget's disease. The alkaline phosphatase blood test measures the level of this substance. A bone scan provides a picture of the affected bones that doctors can use to see how far the disease has progressed. If a bone scan done for another reason suggests Paget's disease, the doctor can order x-rays to confirm the diagnosis. If the Disease Runs in the Family Early diagnosis and treatment of Paget's disease is important. Because Paget's disease can be hereditary, some experts recommend that the brothers, sisters, and children of anyone with the disease talk to their doctor about having an alkaline phosphatase blood test every 2 to 3 years after about age 40."
What are the treatments for Paget's Disease of Bone ?," Treatment for Paget's disease of bone is not always necessary, especially if the disease is mild and not causing any symptoms. However, if the disease is more severe or is causing complications, several treatment options are available:

**Bisphosphonates:** These medications are the mainstay of treatment for Paget's disease of bone. They work by slowing down the excessive bone turnover that occurs in the affected areas. Examples of bisphosphonates used for Paget's disease include alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), ibandronate (Boniva), and zoledronic acid (Reclast).

**Calcitonin:** This hormone, which is naturally produced by the thyroid gland, can help to reduce bone turnover and relieve pain. Calcitonin is typically given as a nasal spray or injection.

**Surgery:** Surgery may be necessary in some cases, such as when there are severe bone deformities or fractures, or when pressure on nerves or blood vessels is causing complications. Surgery may involve removing the affected bone and replacing it with a bone graft, realigning deformed bones, or relieving pressure on nerves or blood vessels.

**Pain relievers:** Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve), can help to relieve pain caused by Paget's disease of bone.

**Physical therapy:** Physical therapy can help to improve mobility and flexibility in areas affected by Paget's disease of bone. Exercises that focus on strengthening the muscles around the affected joints can also help to reduce pain and improve function.

It is important to discuss the appropriate treatment options with a healthcare professional, as the best approach may vary depending on the individual's specific condition and symptoms.","Early Diagnosis is Important Although there is no cure for Paget's disease of bone, it is treatable. Treatment is most effective when the disease is diagnosed early, before it causes major changes in the affected bones. The goal of treatment is to relieve bone pain and prevent the disease from progressing. Medications Are Available The Food and Drug Administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow down the progression of the disease and reduce pain and other symptoms. These medications fall into two categories: bisphosphonates and calcitonin. Both medications work by stopping or reducing the excessive breakdown of old bone that leads to excessive formation of new, but weaker, bone. People with Paget's disease should talk to their doctors about which medication is right for them. Bisphosphonates Six bisphosphonates are currently available for patients with Paget's disease. Doctors most commonly recommend the strongest ones, which include - risedronate  - alendronate   - pamidronate   - zoledronic acid   - tiludronate and etidronate are not as strong but may be appropriate for some patients.  risedronate alendronate pamidronate zoledronic acid tiludronate and etidronate are not as strong but may be appropriate for some patients. Some of the bisphosphonates approved for the treatment of Paget's disease, including risedronate and alendronate, are also approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, people with Paget's disease must take higher dosages of these medicines for shorter periods of time than people with osteoporosis. Calcitonin Doctors also may prescribe calcitonin to treat Paget's disease in some people, although it has been found to be less effective than bisphosphonates. Calcitonin is a naturally occurring hormone made by the thyroid gland. Your doctor may recommend that you repeat calcitonin treatments with brief rest periods in between treatments. The nasal spray form of calcitonin is not recommended or approved to treat Paget's disease. Surgery Surgery may be a treatment option for some people. Hip or knee replacement surgery may help people with severe arthritis. Surgery can also realign affected leg bones to reduce pain or help broken bones heal in a better position. Nutrition and Exercise Good nutrition and exercise are important for bone health, and that is true for people with Paget's disease as well. Women over age 50 should consume 1,200 milligrams (mg) of calcium daily. Men between the ages of 51 and 70 should consume 1,000 mg of calcium a day, and men over 70 should consume 1,200 mg per day. People ages 51 to 70 should consume at least 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily. People over age 70 should consume at least 800 IUs daily. Calcium keeps bones strong, and vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Exercise is very important in maintaining bone health, avoiding weight gain, and keeping joints mobile. However, people with Paget's disease need to avoid putting too much stress on affected bones. They should discuss their exercise program with their doctor to make sure it is a good one for them. Finding New Treatments Recently, there have been major advances in the treatment of Paget's disease of bone. Research into new treatments continues. Some researchers are trying to identify the genetic and viral causes of the disease. Other researchers are learning more about bone biology to better understand how the body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone."
What is (are) Paget's Disease of Bone ?," **Paget's disease of bone** is a chronic disorder in which there is excessive breakdown (resorption) of bone tissue followed by disorganized and structurally abnormal bone formation, leading to thickened, enlarged, and weakened bones and bone deformities. 
Most commonly it affects the pelvis, skull, spine, legs, and arms. 

This condition is also known by the following names:
- Osteitis deformans
- Sir James Paget disease
- Paget disease

Additional symptoms that may be associated with this condition are:
- Bone pain
- Increased head size in adults
- Bowing of legs
- Fractures that usually require more force than a typical fracture (high-energy fractures)
- Hearing loss
- Joint pain
- Enlarged skull (craniomegaly)","Paget's disease of bone is a disease that causes affected bones to become enlarged and misshapen. Our bones are living tissue, and our bodies are constantly breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone. In Paget's disease, however, old bone is broken down and replaced at a faster rate than normal. The new bone is larger and weaker than normal bone."
What are the symptoms of Paget's Disease of Bone ?," The signs and symptoms of Paget's disease of bone vary widely from person to person. Some people do not have any symptoms, while others may have significant bone pain, deformity, and fractures.

**Common symptoms include:**

- **Bone pain:** This is the most common symptom of Paget's disease of bone. The pain may be constant or intermittent, and it may range from mild to severe. It is often worse at night or during activity.
- **Bone deformities:** The abnormal bone growth that occurs with Paget's disease of bone can lead to deformities of the affected bones. This can include bowing of the legs, an enlarged skull, or a hunched back.
- **Fractures:** The weakened bones associated with Paget's disease of bone are more likely to fracture than healthy bones. Fractures can occur spontaneously or as a result of minor trauma.
- **Other symptoms:** Paget's disease of bone can also lead to a number of other symptoms, including:

 - Hearing loss
 - Headaches
 - Vision problems
 - Fatigue
 - Weight loss
 - Joint pain
 - Muscle weakness

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to see your doctor to rule out Paget's disease of bone and other potential causes.","Pain may be a symptom, especially among people with more advanced Paget's disease. Affected bones also can become enlarged, misshapen, and more fragile and likely to break. Misshapen bones tend to be most noticeable in the legs, skull, and spine."
What are the complications of Paget's Disease of Bone ?," **1. Bone pain**

Paget's disease can cause bone pain, which can be mild or severe. The pain is usually worse at night and may be accompanied by swelling, tenderness, and warmth in the affected area.

**2. Fractures**

Paget's disease can weaken bones, making them more susceptible to fractures. Fractures can occur in any bone, but they are most common in the hips, spine, and pelvis.

**3. Deformities**

Paget's disease can cause bones to become deformed. This can lead to a variety of problems, such as:

* Difficulty walking
* Back pain
* Headaches
* Hearing loss
* Vision problems

**4. Arthritis**

Paget's disease can increase the risk of developing arthritis. Arthritis is a condition that causes inflammation of the joints. It can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in the affected joints.

**5. Heart failure**

Paget's disease can increase the risk of developing heart failure. Heart failure is a condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

**6. Kidney failure**

Paget's disease can increase the risk of developing kidney failure. Kidney failure is a condition that occurs when the kidneys are unable to filter waste products from the blood.

**7. Osteosarcoma**

Paget's disease can increase the risk of developing osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer.","Over time, Paget's disease may lead to other medical conditions, including arthritis, headaches, hearing loss, and nervous system problems, depending on which bones are affected. On very rare occasions, Paget's disease is associated with the development of osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. Less than one percent of patients have this complication."
How to diagnose Paget's Disease of Bone ?," **Imaging tests:**

- **X-rays**: X-rays of the affected bone may reveal areas of increased bone density (osteosclerosis) and bone remodeling.


- **Bone scan:** A bone scan involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the bloodstream, which is absorbed by the bones. Areas of increased bone turnover, such as in Paget's disease, will appear as ""hot spots"" on the scan.


- **Computed tomography (CT) scan**: A CT scan provides detailed cross-sectional images of the bones and can help identify the extent of the disease and any associated complications.


- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan**: An MRI scan can provide detailed images of the bones and surrounding soft tissues. It can be useful for evaluating the extent of the disease and identifying any complications.

**Laboratory tests:**

- **Blood tests**: Blood tests may reveal elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone turnover, as well as increased levels of calcium and phosphorus.


- **Urine tests**: Urine tests may show increased levels of hydroxyproline, a marker of bone resorption.


**Biopsy:**

-**Bone biopsy**: A bone biopsy involves taking a small sample of bone tissue from the affected area for examination under a microscope. This is the definitive diagnostic test for Paget's disease and can help rule out other bone disorders.","Paget's disease is almost always diagnosed by x-ray, although it may be discovered using one of two other tests: an alkaline phosphatase blood test or a bone scan. Paget's disease is often found by accident when a person undergoes one of these tests for another reason. In other cases, a person experiences problems that lead his or her physician to order these tests. If Paget's disease is first suggested by an alkaline phosphatase blood test or bone scan, the physician usually orders an x-ray to verify the diagnosis. A bone scan is typically used to identify all the bones in the skeleton that are affected by the disease."

**3. Pain Management**:

   - Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), can help alleviate pain.
   - For severe pain, prescription pain medications may be necessary.

**4. Surgery**:

   - Rarely, severe cases of Paget's Disease may require surgery, especially if there are bone deformities or fractures.
   - Surgical procedures may include osteotomy (cutting and realigning the bone) or total joint replacement.

**5. Physical Therapy**:

   - Physical therapy can help improve mobility, flexibility, and strength in the affected areas.
   - It can also help reduce the risk of falls and further complications.

**6. Lifestyle Modifications**:

   - Maintaining a healthy diet rich in calcium and vitamin D is essential for bone health.
   - Regular exercise can also help support bone strength.
   - Avoiding activities that put excessive stress on the affected bones is recommended.

The specific treatment approach for Paget's Disease of Bone may vary depending on the severity of the condition, the affected bones, and the individual's overall health.

Surgery can also realign affected leg bones to reduce pain or help broken bones heal in a better position.
What is (are) Urinary Tract Infections ?," **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)** are a type of bacterial infection that affects the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. UTIs can occur anywhere in the urinary tract, but they are most common in the bladder and urethra.

**Symptoms of a UTI can include:**

* Burning or pain during urination
* Frequent urination
* Urgent need to urinate
* Cloudy or bloody urine
* Strong-smelling urine
* Pelvic pain
* Fever and chills

**UTIs are diagnosed with a urine test.** The urine test will show if there are bacteria in the urine.

**UTIs are treated with antibiotics.** The antibiotics will kill the bacteria that are causing the infection.

**UTIs can be prevented by:**

* Drinking plenty of fluids
* Wiping from front to back after using the toilet
* Avoiding holding urine for long periods of time
* Emptying the bladder completely when urinating
* Avoiding the use of harsh soaps and feminine hygiene products","A Common Problem With Aging Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common bladder problem, especially as people age. UTIs are the second most common type of infection in the body. Each year, UTIs cause more than 8 million visits to health care providers. UTIs can happen anywhere in the urinary system (which includes the kidneys, bladder, and urethra). But UTIs are most common in the bladder. A UTI in the bladder is called cystitis. Infections in the bladder can spread to the kidneys. A UTI in the kidneys is called pyelonephritis. Sometimes, a UTI can also develop in the urethra, but this is less common. A UTI in the urethra is called urethritis. Some UTIs Lead to Severe Problems Most UTIs are not serious. But some UTIs, such as kidney infections, can lead to severe problems. Bacteria from a kidney infection may spread to the bloodstream, causing a life-threatening condition called septicemia. When kidney infections occur frequently or last a long time, they may cause permanent damage to the kidneys, including kidney scars, poor kidney function, and high blood pressure."
What causes Urinary Tract Infections ?," Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are typically caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and multiply in the bladder. The most common type of bacteria that cause UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is a type of bacteria that is commonly found in the gut. Other types of bacteria that can cause UTIs include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

UTIs can also be caused by viruses, fungi, or parasites, but these are less common.

Risk factors for UTIs include:

* Being female
* Having a history of UTIs
* Having a weakened immune system
* Using a catheter
* Having diabetes
* Being pregnant
* Having kidney stones
* Having an enlarged prostate gland (in men)

UTIs can be prevented by:

* Drinking plenty of fluids
* Wiping from front to back after using the toilet
* Avoiding using harsh soaps or feminine hygiene products
* Emptying the bladder completely when you pee
* Not holding your pee for long periods of time
* Taking antibiotics as prescribed if you have a UTI","Most urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. A type of bacteria that normally lives in the bowel (called E. coli) causes most UTIs. UTIs can also be caused by fungus (another type of germ). Who Gets UTIs? Although everyone has some risk for UTIs, some people are more likely to get UTIs than others. These include people who have - spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder.  - a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder. The blockage can be caused by kidney stones, an enlarged prostate, or a birth defect.  - diabetes  - problems with the bodys natural defense (or immune) system  - pelvic organ prolapse, which is when pelvic organs (such as the bladder, rectum, or uterus) shift out of their normal position into the vagina. When pelvic organs are out of place, they can push on the bladder and urethra and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder. When urine stays in the bladder too long, it makes an infection more likely spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder. a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder.

When pelvic organs are out of place, they can push on the bladder and urethra and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder. When urine stays in the bladder too long, it makes an infection more likely UTIs in Women More than half of women will have at least one UTI in their lifetime. Women are more likely than men to get UTIs because they have a shorter urethra, making it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder. Also, the bowel and urethral openings are closer together in women than in men, making it easier for E. coli (a bacteria that lives in the bowel) to travel from the bowel to the urethra. Many women suffer from frequent UTIs. Some women have 3 or more UTIs a year. However, very few women will have frequent UTIs throughout their lives. More typically, a woman will have a period of 1 or 2 years with frequent UTIs. After this period, the UTIs may stop or happen less often. Older women are more likely to get UTIs because the bladder muscles weaken and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder. When urine stays in the bladder too long, it makes an infection more likely. UTIs in Men Men are less likely than women to have a first UTI. But once a man has a UTI, he is likely to have another. Bacteria from a UTI can spread to the prostate. Once there, the bacteria can hide deep inside prostate tissue. Prostate infections are hard to cure because antibiotics may not be able to reach the infected prostate tissue. Activities That Can Increase Risk - Having sex. Sexual activity can move bacteria from the bowel or vaginal cavity to the urethral opening. Urinating after sex lowers the risk of infection.  - Using a catheter to urinate. A catheter is a tube placed in the urethra and bladder to help people empty the bladder. The catheter can make a direct path for bacteria to reach the bladder.  - Using certain birth controls. Diaphragms can bring bacteria with them when they are placed. Spermicides (a birth control that kills sperm) may also make UTIs more likely. Having sex.

- Frequent urination
- A strong, persistent urge to urinate
- Pain or burning sensation when urinating
- Cloudy, dark, or foul-smelling urine
- Pelvic pain (in women)
- Rectal pain (in men)
- Fever and chills (in severe cases)

**Additional symptoms that may occur in women with UTIs include:**

- Pain in the lower abdomen or back
- Nausea or vomiting
- Fatigue

**Additional symptoms that may occur in men with UTIs include:**

- Difficulty starting urination
- Decreased or weak urine stream
- Pain or swelling in the testicles

**It's important to note that some UTIs, especially in older adults or people with weakened immune systems, may not cause any noticeable symptoms. In these cases, a UTI may be detected only through urine tests.**","Symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the bladder may include - cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine  - pain or burning during urination  - strong and frequent need to urinate, even right after emptying the bladder  - a mild fever below 101 degrees Fahrenheit in some people. cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine pain or burning during urination strong and frequent need to urinate, even right after emptying the bladder a mild fever below 101 degrees Fahrenheit in some people.

Symptoms May Vary Symptoms may differ depending on age, gender, and catheter use. In some elderly people, mental changes and confusion may be the only signs of a UTI. Older women and men with a UTI are more likely to be tired, shaky, and weak. They are also more likely to have muscle aches and abdominal pain. In a person with a catheter, the only symptom may be fever that does not have another likely cause. Germs without Symptoms Some people may have germs in the bladder or urinary tract, but not feel any symptoms. If a urine test shows that you have germs in your urine, but you do not feel any symptoms, you may not need any treatment. If you have germs in your urine but you feel okay, talk to your health care provider about whether antibiotics -- the medications that treat UTIs -- are needed. Diagnosis  To find out if a person has a UTI, the health care provider will ask about symptoms. He or she will then test a sample of urine. The urine test looks for bacteria that may cause the infection. The urine test also looks for white blood cells, which the body makes to fight infection. Because healthy people sometimes have bacteria in their urine, both bacteria and white blood cells must be in the urine to diagnose a UTI. If a person has UTIs often, the health care provider may order some extra tests to see if the persons urinary tract is normal.

How to prevent Urinary Tract Infections ?," Preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) involves adopting healthy habits and taking preventive measures to reduce the risk of bacterial growth and infection in the urinary tract. Here are some tips to help prevent UTIs:

**1. Maintain Good Hygiene**:
- Practice good personal hygiene, especially after using the toilet.
- Wipe from front to back after urination or a bowel movement to prevent bacteria from entering the urethra.

**2. Stay Hydrated**:
- Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to flush out bacteria and keep the urine diluted, reducing the risk of infection.

**3. Empty Bladder Regularly**:
- Avoid holding your urine for long periods. Empty your bladder frequently to prevent bacterial build-up.

**4. Avoid Bladder Irritants**:
- Limit or avoid consuming certain beverages like caffeinated drinks and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder.

**5. Practice Safe Sex**:
- Use protection during sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of introducing bacteria into the urethra.

**6. Choose Cotton Underwear**:
- Wear breathable cotton underwear to allow proper airflow and prevent moisture build-up in the genital area.

**7. Change Diapers Frequently**:
- If you're caring for someone who uses diapers, change them frequently to prevent bacterial growth.

**8. Stay Clean During Menstruation**:
- During menstruation, change sanitary products regularly and maintain proper hygiene.

**9. Treat Underlying Medical Conditions**:
- Manage underlying health conditions like diabetes and kidney stones that may increase the risk of UTIs.

**10. Consult a Doctor**:
- If you experience frequent or recurring UTIs, talk to your doctor. They may recommend preventive measures or prescribe antibiotics if necessary.

Remember, consult a healthcare professional if you experience any symptoms of a UTI, such as frequent urination, pain or burning during urination, or cloudy or foul-smelling urine. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications.","Changing some of these daily habits may help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). - Wipe from front to back after using the toilet.

What is (are) Urinary Tract Infections ?," **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)** are common bacterial infections that can affect any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. UTIs are most often caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), a type of bacteria that is found in the digestive tract. UTIs can occur in people of all ages, but they are more common in women than in men.

**Symptoms of a UTI can include:**

* Frequent urination
* Pain or burning during urination
* Cloudy or dark urine
* Strong-smelling urine
* Pelvic pain
* Fever
* Chills
* Nausea
* Vomiting

**UTIs can be treated with antibiotics.** The type of antibiotic prescribed will depend on the type of bacteria that is causing the infection. Treatment usually lasts for 7-10 days.

**To prevent UTIs, it is important to:**

* Drink plenty of fluids, especially water.
* Avoid holding your urine for long periods of time.
* Wipe from front to back after using the bathroom.
* Avoid using harsh soaps or douches in the genital area.
* Change your underwear frequently.
* Avoid sexual intercourse until the UTI is cleared up.

**If you experience any symptoms of a UTI, it is important to see a doctor right away.** Early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent serious complications.","Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common bladder problem, especially as people age. UTIs are the second most common type of infection in the body. Each year, UTIs cause more than 8 million visits to health care providers. UTIs can happen anywhere in the urinary system (which includes the kidneys, bladder, and urethra). But UTIs are most common in the bladder. A UTI in the bladder is called cystitis. Infections in the bladder can spread to the kidneys. A UTI in the kidneys is called pyelonephritis. Sometimes, a UTI can also develop in the urethra, but this is less common. A UTI in the urethra is called urethritis. Learn more about urinary tract infections in adults."
What are the symptoms of Urinary Tract Infections ?," **Common symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs) include:**

- Frequent urination
- A strong, persistent urge to urinate
- Pain or burning sensation when urinating
- Cloudy, dark, or foul-smelling urine
- Pelvic pain (in women)
- Rectal pain (in men)
- Fever and chills (in severe cases)

- Pain in the lower abdomen or back
- Nausea or vomiting
- Fatigue

**Additional symptoms that may occur in men with UTIs include:**

- Difficulty starting urination
- Decreased or weak urine stream
- Pain or swelling in the testicles

**It's important to note that some UTIs, especially in older adults or people with weakened immune systems, may not cause any noticeable symptoms. In these cases, a UTI may be detected only through urine tests.**","Symptoms of a UTI in the bladder may include - cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine  - pain or burning during urination  - strong and frequent need to urinate, even right after emptying the bladder  - a mild fever below 101 degrees Fahrenheit in some people. cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine pain or burning during urination strong and frequent need to urinate, even right after emptying the bladder a mild fever below 101 degrees Fahrenheit in some people.

Symptoms may differ depending on age, gender, and catheter use. In some elderly people, mental changes and confusion may be the only signs of a UTI. Older women and men with a UTI are more likely to be tired, shaky, and weak. They are also more likely to have muscle aches and abdominal pain. In a person with a catheter, the only symptom may be fever that does not have another likely cause. Learn more about the signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections in adults."
Who is at risk for Urinary Tract Infections? ?," Several factors increase the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI):

**1. Female Gender**: Women are more likely to get UTIs than men because the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body) is shorter in women, making it easier for bacteria to enter the bladder.

**2. Age**: Elderly individuals are more susceptible to UTIs due to decreased immune function and changes in the urinary tract that occur with aging.

**3. Sexual Activity**: Sexual intercourse can introduce bacteria into the urethra, increasing the risk of infection.

**4. Pregnancy**: Hormonal changes during pregnancy can increase the risk of UTIs.

**5. Diabetes**: Diabetes can damage the nerves that control bladder function, leading to incomplete emptying of the bladder and an increased risk of UTI.

**6. Weakened Immune System**: Conditions that impair the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, or certain medications, can increase the susceptibility to UTIs.

**7. Bladder Obstruction**: Any obstruction in the urinary tract, such as kidney stones, an enlarged prostate, or strictures (narrowing) of the urethra, can lead to urine retention and an increased risk of UTI.

**8. Use of Catheters**: Indwelling urinary catheters (tubes placed into the bladder to drain urine) can bypass the body's natural defenses, increasing the risk of infection.

**9. Recent Urinary Tract Surgery or Procedures**: Surgical interventions in the urinary tract can introduce bacteria or disrupt the normal flow of urine, leading to an increased risk of UTI.

**10. Kidney Stones**: Kidney stones can obstruct the flow of urine and provide a nidus for bacterial growth, increasing the risk of UTI.

**11. Compromised Mobility**: Individuals with limited mobility or who are bedridden may have difficulty emptying their bladders completely, increasing the risk of urine stasis and UTI.

It's important for individuals at risk for UTIs to maintain good hygiene practices, drink plenty of fluids, and seek prompt medical attention if symptoms of a UTI develop.","Although everyone has some risk for UTIs, some people are more likely to get UTIs than others. These include people who have -  spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder   -  a blockage in the urinary tract that can trap urine in the bladder. A blockage in the urinary tract can be caused by kidney stones, an enlarged prostate, or a birth defect.   -  diabetes   -  problems with the bodys natural defense (or immune) system   -  pelvic organ prolapse, which is when pelvic organs (such as the bladder, rectum, or uterus) shift out of their normal position into the vagina. When pelvic organs are out of place, they can push on the bladder and urethra and make it hard to fully empty the bladder. This causes urine to stay in the bladder.

How to prevent Urinary Tract Infections ?," Preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) involves adopting healthy habits and taking preventive measures to reduce the risk of bacterial growth and infection in the urinary tract. Here are some tips to help prevent UTIs:

**1. Stay Hydrated:**
- Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to flush out bacteria from the urinary tract.

**2. Practice Good Hygiene:**
- Always wipe from front to back after using the bathroom to prevent bacteria from entering the urethra.

**3. Empty Your Bladder Regularly:**
- Avoid holding your urine for extended periods. Empty your bladder as soon as you feel the urge.

**4. Cranberry Consumption:**
- Consuming cranberry juice or cranberry extract can help prevent the adherence of bacteria to the bladder walls.

**5. Avoid Potential Irritants:**
- Certain foods, beverages, and products may irritate the bladder and increase the risk of UTIs. Avoid consuming excessive amounts of caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods.

**6. Probiotics:**
- Eating yogurt or taking probiotic supplements can help maintain a healthy balance of good bacteria in the body.

**7. Practice Safe Intercourse:**
- Use protection during sexual intercourse and make sure to urinate shortly afterward to flush out any bacteria.

**8. Keep the Genital Area Clean:**
- Cleanse the genital area regularly, especially before and after sexual activity.

**9. Cotton Undergarments:**
- Wear loose, cotton undergarments to allow for air circulation and prevent moisture buildup.

**10. Avoid Using Feminine Hygiene Products:**
- Some feminine hygiene products, such as douches and sprays, can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina.

**11. Stay Active:**
- Regular physical activity can help prevent constipation and maintain good circulation, reducing the risk of UTIs.

**12. Proper Toilet Use:**
- Avoid sitting on public toilets for extended periods. Use disposable toilet seat covers if necessary.

**13. Treat Underlying Medical Conditions:**
- If you have a medical condition that increases the risk of UTIs, such as diabetes or a weakened immune system, work closely with your healthcare provider to manage the condition.

**14. Postmenopausal Care:**
- Women who are postmenopausal may be more susceptible to UTIs due to changes in hormone levels. Consult with your healthcare provider for preventive strategies.

**15. Seek Prompt Medical Care:**
- If you experience symptoms of a UTI, such as frequent urination, burning sensation during urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, or lower abdominal discomfort, see a healthcare professional for prompt diagnosis and treatment.

By following these prevention strategies, you can reduce the risk of developing urinary tract infections and maintain overall urinary health.","Changing some of these daily habits may help prevent UTIs. - Wipe from front to back after using the toilet. Women should wipe from front to back to keep bacteria from getting into the urethra. This step is most important after a bowel movement.  Wipe from front to back after using the toilet. Women should wipe from front to back to keep bacteria from getting into the urethra. This step is most important after a bowel movement.  - Drink lots of fluid, especially water.

What are the treatments for Urinary Tract Infections ?," **Antibiotics:** The mainstay of treatment for UTIs is antibiotics. The specific antibiotic prescribed will depend on the type of bacteria causing the infection. Common antibiotics used for UTIs include:
* Nitrofurantoin
* Trimethoprim
* Sulfamethoxazole
* Amoxicillin-clavulanate
* Ciprofloxacin
* Levofloxacin

**Antibiotic Duration:** The duration of antibiotic treatment for UTIs typically ranges from 3 to 7 days, although longer courses may be necessary for more severe infections. It is crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if symptoms improve, to eradicate the infection and prevent recurrence.

**Pain Relievers:** Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help reduce fever, aches, and discomfort associated with UTIs.

**Fluids:** Drinking plenty of fluids, particularly water, helps flush out bacteria from the urinary tract and dilutes urine, reducing irritation.

**Frequent Urination:** Urinating regularly and emptying the bladder completely can help prevent bacteria from accumulating in the urinary tract.

**Adequate Rest:** Resting and avoiding strenuous activities allow the body to focus on fighting the infection.

**Preventive Measures:** To reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs, certain preventive measures can be helpful, including:
* Proper hygiene, especially after sexual activity or bowel movements
* Avoiding憋尿
* Staying hydrated
* Cranberry juice or supplements, which may help prevent bacteria from adhering to the bladder walls
* Probiotics, which support a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut and urinary tract

**Consulting a Healthcare Professional:** If symptoms of a UTI, such as frequent urination, pain or burning during urination, fever, or cloudy urine, persist or worsen despite home remedies or over-the-counter medications, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.","Because most UTIs are caused by bacteria, bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics are the usual treatment. The type of antibiotic and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. Bladder infections may eventually get better on their own. But antibiotics can make the symptoms go away much more quickly. People usually feel better within a day or two of starting antibiotics. Drinking lots of fluids and urinating often may also speed healing. If needed, pain-killers can relieve the pain of a UTI. A heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help.

What is (are) Alcohol Use and Older Adults ?," Alcohol Use and Older Adults

As people age, their bodies change, and the effects of alcohol can be more pronounced. This is because older adults have less water in their bodies, so the same amount of alcohol can lead to a higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC). In addition, older adults may have slower metabolisms, so it takes longer for their bodies to break down alcohol.

Certain medications, illnesses, and medical conditions that are more common in older adults can interact poorly with alcohol, causing the medication to be less effective or even harmful. Drinking alcohol can worsen health problems, such as heart disease, liver damage, and diabetes.

Alcohol can also cause falls, injuries, and cognitive impairment, such as memory loss and confusion. It can also increase the risk of developing depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Because of these risks, it is important for older adults to drink in moderation or not at all.

Drinking in moderation means limiting your alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day for women and three drinks per day for men. One drink is equivalent to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor.

If you are concerned about your alcohol intake or if you have any questions about how alcohol can affect your health, talk to your doctor.","Alcohol, also known as ethanol, is a chemical found in beverages like beer, wine, and distilled spirits such as whiskey, vodka, and rum. Through a process called fermentation, yeast converts the sugars naturally found in grains and grapes into the alcohol that is in beer and wine. Another process, called distillation, concentrates alcohol in the drink making it stronger, producing what are known as distilled spirits."
What is (are) Alcohol Use and Older Adults ?," Alcohol Use and Older Adults

Alcohol use among older adults is a growing concern. In the United States, the percentage of adults aged 65 and older who drink alcohol has increased from 53% in 1997 to 64% in 2015. This increase is expected to continue as the population ages.

What is (are) Alcohol Use and Older Adults ?," Alcohol Use and Older Adults:

As individuals enter their senior years, aging-related changes can affect how the body processes and responds to alcohol. Some important considerations regarding alcohol use and older adults include:

* **Metabolism:** As we age, our metabolism slows down, which can lead to alcohol remaining in the body for a longer period. This increased exposure can magnify the effects of alcohol on the body.

* **Reduced Muscle Mass:** Aging is often accompanied by a loss of muscle mass and an increase in body fat. Since alcohol is primarily distributed in water, a higher body fat percentage means that there is less water available to dilute the alcohol, resulting in a higher concentration of alcohol in the blood.

* **Medication Interactions:** Many older adults take medications to manage various health conditions. Alcohol can interact with certain medications, potentially causing adverse effects or reducing the effectiveness of the medications.

* **Increased Sensitivity:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, experiencing impairment with smaller amounts of alcohol consumption compared to younger individuals. This increased sensitivity can increase the risk of falls, injuries, and other accidents.

* **Health Risks:** Alcohol misuse can exacerbate existing health conditions or increase the risk of developing certain diseases, including liver damage, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer. Chronic alcohol use can also contribute to cognitive decline and worsen memory impairment.

* **Social and Emotional Impact:** Alcohol use may interfere with social interactions and relationships, especially if it leads to inappropriate behaviors or impaired judgment. It can also exacerbate feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety, which are common among older adults.

Older adults should be cautious and responsible about alcohol consumption, considering their unique vulnerabilities and the potential risks associated with alcohol use. Moderation is key, and it's essential to be aware of individual health conditions, medications, and personal tolerance levels when making decisions about alcohol consumption.","Some people with an alcohol use disorder are treated in a facility, such as a hospital, mental health center, or substance abuse clinic. Treatment may last as long as several weeks. This type of treatment typically involves detoxification (when a person is weaned from alcohol), medicine, and counseling.  Learn more about treatment settings for alcohol problems.   Use the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator to find a treatment facility."
What are the treatments for Alcohol Use and Older Adults ?," There are several evidence-based treatment options for alcohol use disorders among older adults. These include:

- Behavioral Therapy: Approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing can help individuals change their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to alcohol use.
- Medications: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several medications to treat alcohol use disorders, including naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram.
- Mutual Support Groups: Programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and SMART Recovery provide a supportive environment where older adults can connect with others who are working towards alcohol abstinence or moderation.
- Brief Interventions: Healthcare professionals may conduct brief interventions during routine medical visits, providing older adults with information, support, and resources for addressing alcohol use.
- Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA): This approach focuses on building positive social and environmental factors that support abstinence, such as increasing social support, improving coping skills, and enhancing access to resources.
- Mindfulness-Based Interventions: Practices like mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindful drinking may help older adults become more aware of their behaviors, thoughts, and emotions related to alcohol use and make healthier choices.
- Family Therapy: Involving the family in the treatment process can provide support and help address family dynamics that may contribute to alcohol use.
- Contingency Management: This approach uses a system of rewards and consequences based on alcohol use behavior to encourage abstinence or moderation.
- Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET): MET focuses on increasing motivation and readiness for change by helping older adults explore the pros and cons of reducing alcohol use and setting realistic goals.

It's important for older adults to discuss treatment options with their healthcare provider or a qualified addiction specialist to determine the most appropriate and effective treatment approach based on their individual needs and circumstances.","Most people with alcohol problems can be treated successfully. People with an alcohol use disorder and those who misuse alcohol and cannot stay within healthy drinking limits should stop drinking altogether. Others can cut back until their drinking is under control. Changing drinking habits isnt easy. Often it takes more than one try to succeed. But people dont have to go it alone. There are plenty of sources of help. (Watch the video to learn more about getting help for alcohol use disorder (AUD). To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) A doctor can help decide the best treatment for people with alcohol problems. Many people need more than one kind of treatment. Medicines can help people with an alcohol use disorder quit drinking. Meeting with a therapist or substance-abuse counselor or with a support group may also help. Support from family and friends is important, too. Making a change sooner rather than later makes treatment more likely to succeed. When treatment is successful, people have longer and longer periods without drinking alcohol. Finally, they are able to stop drinking or stick to healthy drinking limits. But treatment does not always work. Relapse is common among people who overcome alcohol problems. People with drinking problems are most likely to relapse during periods of stress or when exposed to people or places associated with past drinking.  Learn more about the treatment process for alcohol use disorder."
What are the treatments for Alcohol Use and Older Adults ?," There are a variety of treatments available for alcohol use disorder in older adults, including:

1. **Behavioral therapy**: This type of therapy can help older adults understand their drinking habits, identify the triggers that lead to drinking, and develop coping mechanisms to avoid relapse.
2. **Pharmacotherapy**: Medications such as naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram can be effective in reducing alcohol consumption and preventing relapse.
3. **Social support**: Older adults who are struggling with alcohol use disorder may benefit from support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or SMART Recovery. These groups can provide a safe and supportive environment in which older adults can share their experiences and learn from others who are facing similar challenges.
4. **Family therapy**: Family therapy can help older adults and their families address the impact of alcohol use disorder on their relationships and learn how to support each other.
5. **Long-term care**: Some older adults who are struggling with alcohol use disorder may need to receive long-term care in a residential setting. These settings can provide older adults with the support and supervision they need to stay sober.",Older people with alcohol problems respond to treatment as well as younger people. Some studies suggest that older adults do better when they are treated with other people the same age instead of mixed in with younger adults. Some communities have treatment programs and support groups specifically for older adults.
What is (are) Osteoarthritis ?," **Osteoarthritis (OA)** is a degenerative joint disease that occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones wears down over time. It is the most common type of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. OA can occur in any joint, but it most commonly affects the knees, hips, spine, hands, and feet.

**Causes of Osteoarthritis:**
The exact cause of OA is not known, but several factors can contribute to its development:
- Age: OA is more common in older adults as the cartilage naturally wears down with age.
- Obesity: Excess weight puts stress on joints, increasing the risk of OA.
- Genetics: Some people may have a genetic predisposition to OA.
- Joint injuries: Previous injuries to a joint can increase the risk of developing OA in that joint.
- Certain occupations or sports: Repetitive motions or heavy lifting can put stress on joints and increase the risk of OA.

**Symptoms of Osteoarthritis:**
The symptoms of OA can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the affected joint. Common symptoms include:
- Joint pain: Pain is usually worse with movement and improves with rest.
- Stiffness: Joints may feel stiff, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity.
- Swelling: Joints may become swollen and warm to the touch.
- Tenderness: Joints may be tender to the touch.
- Loss of flexibility: The range of motion in the affected joint may decrease.
- Grating or clicking sounds: A person may hear grating or clicking sounds when moving the affected joint.

**Treatment for Osteoarthritis:**
There is no cure for OA, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve joint function. Treatment options may include:
- Weight loss: Losing weight can help reduce stress on joints and improve symptoms.
- Exercise: Low-impact exercises such as walking, swimming, and cycling can help strengthen muscles around the joints and improve flexibility.
- Physical therapy: A physical therapist can teach specific exercises to improve joint function and reduce pain.
- Medications: Over-the-counter or prescription medications can help relieve pain and inflammation.
- Injections: Corticosteroid injections or hyaluronic acid injections can help reduce pain and improve joint function.
- Surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair damaged joints or replace them with artificial joints.

It's important to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment of osteoarthritis to manage the condition effectively and prevent further joint damage.","Affects Many Older People Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis among older people, and it is one of the most frequent causes of physical disability among older adults. The disease affects both men and women. Before age 45, osteoarthritis is more common in men than in women. After age 45, osteoarthritis is more common in women. It is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease. Osteoarthritis occurs when cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of the bones within the joints, breaks down and wears away. In some cases, all of the cartilage may wear away, leaving bones that rub up against each other. Joint Stiffness and Pain Symptoms range from stiffness and mild pain that comes and goes to severe joint pain. Osteoarthritis affects hands, low back, neck, and weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and feet. osteoarthritis affects just joints, not internal organs. Hands Osteoarthritis of the hands seems to run in families. If your mother or grandmother has or had osteoarthritis in their hands, youre at greater-than-average risk of having it too. Women are more likely than men to have osteoarthritis in the hands. For most women, it develops after menopause. When osteoarthritis involves the hands, small, bony knobs may appear on the end joints (those closest to the nails) of the fingers. They are called Heberdens (HEBerr-denz) nodes. Similar knobs, called Bouchards (boo-SHARDZ) nodes, can appear on the middle joints of the fingers. Fingers can become enlarged and gnarled, and they may ache or be stiff and numb. The base of the thumb joint also is commonly affected by osteoarthritis. Knees The knees are among the joints most commonly affected by osteoarthritis. Symptoms of knee osteoarthritis include stiffness, swelling, and pain, which make it hard to walk, climb, and get in and out of chairs and bathtubs. Osteoarthritis in the knees can lead to disability. Hips The hips are also common sites of osteoarthritis. As with knee osteoarthritis, symptoms of hip osteoarthritis include pain and stiffness of the joint itself. But sometimes pain is felt in the groin, inner thigh, buttocks, or even the knees. Osteoarthritis of the hip may limit moving and bending, making daily activities such as dressing and putting on shoes a challenge. Spine Osteoarthritis of the spine may show up as stiffness and pain in the neck or lower back. In some cases, arthritis-related changes in the spine can cause pressure on the nerves where they exit the spinal column, resulting in weakness, tingling, or numbness of the arms and legs. In severe cases, this can even affect bladder and bowel function."
What causes Osteoarthritis ?," **Osteoarthritis (OA)** is a degenerative joint disease that occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones wears down over time. Although OA can affect any joint, it most commonly affects the knees, hips, spine, hands, and feet.

**The exact cause of OA is not fully understood, but several factors are known to contribute to the development of the disease, including:**

**Age:** OA is most common in older adults, as the cartilage naturally wears down with age.

**Obesity:** Excess weight puts extra stress on the joints, which can lead to wear and tear of the cartilage.

**Genetics:** Some people are more likely to develop OA if they have a family history of the disease.

**Joint injury:** A previous joint injury, such as a fracture or dislocation, can increase the risk of developing OA in that joint.

**Repetitive motion:** Jobs or activities that involve repetitive motions can put extra stress on the joints and lead to OA.

**Other factors:** Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, can also increase the risk of OA.

**Risk Factors**:
- Age
- Obesity
- Genetics
- Joint injury
- Repetitive motion
- Medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis)","Risk Increases With Age Researchers suspect that osteoarthritis is caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment. The chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. It is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease. Wear and Tear on Joints Affects Cartilage Osteoarthritis often results from years of wear and tear on joints. This wear and tear mostly affects the cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of bones within the joint. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage begins to fray, wear away, and decay. Putting too much stress on a joint that has been previously injured, improper alignment of joints, and excess weight all may contribute to the development of osteoarthritis."

It is the most common type of arthritis, and it can affect any joint in the body, but it most commonly affects the knees, hips, spine, hands, and feet.

Symptoms of osteoarthritis may include:

* Joint pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest
* Stiffness in the joints, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity
* Swelling and tenderness around the affected joint
* Creaking or grinding sensation when moving the affected joint
* Loss of flexibility in the affected joint
* Bone spurs (small bony growths) around the affected joint
* Weakness in the muscles around the affected joint
* Fatigue
* Weight loss (in severe cases)

OA can range from mild to severe. In mild cases, people may experience occasional pain and stiffness. In severe cases, people may have difficulty walking or performing other everyday activities.

There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but there are treatments that can help to relieve pain and stiffness and improve function. Treatment options may include:

* Exercise
* Physical therapy
* Weight loss
* Medications (such as pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids)
* Surgery (in severe cases)

If you are experiencing symptoms of osteoarthritis, it is important to see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve your quality of life.","Pain and Stiffness in Joints Different types of arthritis have different symptoms. In general, people with most forms of arthritis have pain and stiffness in their joints. Osteoarthritis usually develops slowly and can occur in any joint, but often occurs in weight-bearing joints. Early in the disease, joints may ache after physical work or exercise. Most often, osteoarthritis occurs in the hands, hips, knees, neck, or low back. Common Signs Common signs of osteoarthritis include - joint pain, swelling, and tenderness  - stiffness after getting out of bed  - a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone. joint pain, swelling, and tenderness stiffness after getting out of bed a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone. Not everyone with osteoarthritis feels pain, however. In fact, only a third of people with x-ray evidence of osteoarthritis report pain or other symptoms. Diagnosis To make a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, most doctors use a combination of methods and tests including a medical history, a physical examination, x-rays, and laboratory tests. - A medical history is the patient's description of symptoms and when and how they began. The description covers pain, stiffness, and joint function, and how these have changed over time.   - A physical examination includes the doctor's examination of the joints, skin, reflexes, and muscle strength. The doctor observes the patient's ability to walk, bend, and carry out activities of daily living.  - X-rays are limited in their capacity to reveal how much joint damage may have occurred in osteoarthritis. X-rays usually don't show osteoarthritis damage until there has been a significant loss of cartilage.  A medical history is the patient's description of symptoms and when and how they began.

Questions Your Doctor May Ask It is important for people with joint pain to give the doctor a complete medical history. Answering these questions will help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis: - Is the pain in one or more joints?  - When does the pain occur and how long does it last?  - When did you first notice the pain?  - Does activity make the pain better or worse?  - Have you had any illnesses or accidents that may account for the pain?  - Is there a family history of any arthritis or rheumatic diseases?  - What medicines are you taking? Is the pain in one or more joints? When does the pain occur and how long does it last? When did you first notice the pain? Does activity make the pain better or worse? Have you had any illnesses or accidents that may account for the pain? Is there a family history of any arthritis or rheumatic diseases? What medicines are you taking? A patient's attitudes, daily activities, and levels of anxiety or depression have a lot to do with how severe the symptoms of osteoarthritis may be. Who Can Provide Care Treating arthritis often requires a multidisciplinary or team approach. Many types of health professionals care for people with arthritis. You may choose a few or more of the following professionals to be part of your health care team. - Primary care physicians -- doctors who treat patients before they are referred to other specialists in the health care system. Often a primary care physician will be the main doctor to treat your arthritis.

What are the treatments for Osteoarthritis ?," Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but there are a number of treatments that can help to relieve symptoms and improve function.

**Nonsurgical treatments**

Nonsurgical treatments for osteoarthritis include:

* **Weight loss.** Losing weight can help to reduce stress on the joints and improve symptoms of osteoarthritis.
* **Exercise.** Exercise can help to strengthen the muscles around the joints and improve flexibility. It can also help to reduce pain and stiffness.
* **Physical therapy.** Physical therapy can help to improve range of motion, strength, and flexibility. It can also help to reduce pain and stiffness.
* **Occupational therapy.** Occupational therapy can help people with osteoarthritis to learn how to perform everyday activities in a way that minimizes pain and stiffness.
* **Assistive devices.** Assistive devices, such as canes, crutches, and walkers, can help people with osteoarthritis to walk and move more easily.
* **Medication.** Over-the-counter and prescription medications can help to relieve pain and inflammation.

**Surgical treatments**

Surgical treatments for osteoarthritis include:

* **Arthroscopy.** Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgery that can be used to remove damaged tissue and repair the joint.
* **Osteotomy.** Osteotomy is a surgery that involves cutting the bone around the joint to realign it and reduce stress on the joint.
* **Joint replacement.** Joint replacement is a surgery that involves removing the damaged joint and replacing it with an artificial joint.

The type of treatment that is best for a person with osteoarthritis will depend on the severity of the condition, the person's age and activity level, and other factors.","Treatment Goals: Manage Pain, Improve Function Osteoarthritis treatment plans often include ways to manage pain and improve function. Such plans can include exercise, rest and joint care, pain relief, weight control, medicines, surgery, and non-traditional treatment approaches. Current treatments for osteoarthritis can relieve symptoms such as pain and disability, but right now there are no treatments that can cure osteoarthritis. Exercise: One of the Best Treatments Exercise is one of the best treatments for osteoarthritis. It can improve mood and outlook, decrease pain, increase flexibility, and help you maintain a healthy weight. The amount and form of exercise will depend on which joints are involved, how stable the joints are, whether or not the joint is swollen, and whether a joint replacement has already been done. Ask your doctor or physical therapist what exercises are best for you The following types of exercise are part of a well-rounded arthritis treatment plan. -  Strengthening exercises.  These exercises strengthen muscles that support joints affected by arthritis. They can be performed with weights or with exercise bands, inexpensive devices that add resistance.  - Aerobic activities.  These are exercises, such as brisk walking or low-impact aerobics, that get your heart pumping and can keep your lungs and circulatory system in shape.   -  Range-of-motion activities.  These keep your joints limber.  - Balance and agility exercises.  These help you maintain your balance and reduce the risk of falling.   Strengthening exercises.

To see examples of exercises for older adults, see  Exercises to Try or visit Go4Life,  the National Institute on Agings exercise and physical activity program for older adults. Weight Control If you are overweight or obese, you should try to lose weight. Weight loss can reduce stress on weight-bearing joints, limit further injury, increase mobility, and reduce the risk of associated health problems. A dietitian can help you develop healthy eating habits. A healthy diet and regular exercise help reduce weight. Rest and Relief from Stress on Joints Treatment plans include regularly scheduled rest. You must learn to recognize the bodys signals, and know when to stop or slow down. This will prevent the pain caused by overexertion. Although pain can make it difficult to sleep, getting proper sleep is important for managing arthritis pain. If you have trouble sleeping, you may find that relaxation techniques, stress reduction, and biofeedback can help. Timing medications to provide maximum pain relief through the night can also help. If joint pain interferes with your ability to sleep or rest, consult your doctor. Some people find relief from special footwear and insoles that can reduce pain and improve walking or from using canes to take pressure off painful joints. They may use splints or braces to provide extra support for joints and/ or keep them in proper position during sleep or activity. Splints should be used only for limited periods of time because joints and muscles need to be exercised to prevent stiffness and weakness. If you need a splint, an occupational therapist or a doctor can help you get a properly fitted one. Non-drug Pain Relief and Alternative Therapies People with osteoarthritis may find many nondrug ways to relieve pain. Below are some examples. - Heat and cold. Heat or cold (or a combination of the two) can be useful for joint pain. Heat can be applied in a number of different ways -- with warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower -- to increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness. In some cases, cold packs (bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel), which reduce inflammation, can relieve pain or numb the sore area.

Some people have found pain relief using acupuncture, a practice in which fine needles are inserted by a licensed acupuncture therapist at specific points on the skin. Scientists think the needles stimulate the release of natural, pain-relieving chemicals produced by the nervous system. A large study supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) revealed that acupuncture relieves pain and improves function in knee osteoarthritis, and it serves as an effective complement to standard care.

These include the wearing of copper bracelets, following special diets, and rubbing WD-40 on joints to lubricate them. Although these practices may or may not be harmful, no scientific research to date shows that they are helpful in treating osteoarthritis. They can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. Folk remedies.

They can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. For general information on alternative therapies, see the Complementary Health Approaches topic. Medications Doctors consider a number of factors when choosing medicines for their patients. In particular, they look at the type of pain the patient may be having and any possible side effects from the drugs. For pain relief, doctors usually start with acetaminophen because the side effects are minimal. If acetaminophen does not relieve pain, then non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen may be used. Some NSAIDs are available over the counter, while more than a dozen others, including a subclass called COX-2 inhibitors, are available only with a prescription. Other medications, including corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and topical creams are also used. Reduce the Risks of NSAID Use Most medicines used to treat osteoarthritis have side effects, so it is important for people to learn about the medicines they take. For example, people over age 65 and those with any history of ulcers or stomach bleeding should use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, with caution. There are measures you can take to help reduce the risk of side effects associated with NSAIDs. These include taking medications with food and avoiding stomach irritants such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. In some cases, it may help to take another medication along with an NSAID to coat the stomach or block stomach acids. Although these measures may help, they are not always completely effective. For more tips on how older adults can avoid side effects, see Side Effects  in the Taking Medicines topic. Surgery For many people, surgery helps relieve the pain and disability of osteoarthritis. Surgery may be performed to achieve one or more of the following goals. - Removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement).  - Repositioning of bones (osteotomy).  - Resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). Removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement). Repositioning of bones (osteotomy). Resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). Joint Replacement Surgeons may replace affected joints with artificial joints called prostheses. These joints can be made from metal alloys, high-density plastic, and ceramic material. Some prostheses are joined to bone surfaces with special cements. Others have porous surfaces and rely on the growth of bone into that surface (a process called biologic fixation) to hold them in place. Artificial joints can last 10 to 15 years or longer. Surgeons choose the design and components of prostheses according to their patients weight, sex, age, activity level, and other medical conditions. Joint replacement advances in recent years have included the ability, in some cases, to replace only the damaged part of the knee joint, leaving undamaged parts of the joint intact, and the ability to perform hip replacement through much smaller incisions than previously possible. For more on joint replacement see the Hip Replacement and Knee Replacement topics. Deciding on Surgery The decision to use surgery depends on several factors, including the patients age, occupation, level of disability, pain intensity, and the degree to which arthritis interferes with his or her lifestyle. After surgery and rehabilitation, the patient usually feels less pain and swelling and can move more easily."
What is (are) Osteoarthritis ?," **Osteoarthritis**, also known as **degenerative joint disease**, is the most common chronic condition of the joints. It is a degenerative disease that affects the cartilage, the soft tissue that cushions the ends of bones where they come together to form joints. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage gradually wears down and can eventually disappear, leaving bone rubbing against bone. This can cause pain, stiffness, tenderness, and swelling in the affected joints. Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, but it is most common in the knees, hips, hands, spine, and neck.

**Risk factors for osteoarthritis include:**

* Age: Osteoarthritis is more common as people get older.
* Sex: Women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis than men.
* Obesity: Obese people are more likely to develop osteoarthritis.
* Family history: People with a family history of osteoarthritis are more likely to develop the condition.
* Joint injury: A joint injury can damage the cartilage and increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis.
* Repetitive motion: Repetitive motion can put stress on the joints and increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis.","Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis among older people. It affects hands, low back, neck, and weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and feet. Osteoarthritis occurs when cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of the bones within the joints, breaks down and wears away. This causes bones to rub together, causing pain, swelling, and loss of motion of the joint."
How many people are affected by Osteoarthritis ?," According to the World Health Organization (WHO), osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 9.6% of the world's population, or approximately 792 million people. It is more prevalent in women than men and is more likely to occur in older adults. The condition is characterized by the degeneration and breakdown of joint cartilage, which is the protective tissue that cushions the ends of bones. This can lead to pain, stiffness, swelling, and decreased mobility in the affected joints.",The chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. It is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease.
What causes Osteoarthritis ?," **Osteoarthritis (OA)** is a degenerative joint disease that occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones wears down over time. Although OA can affect any joint, it most commonly affects the knees, hips, spine, neck, hands, and feet.

The exact cause of OA is not fully understood, but several factors are known to contribute to its development, including:

**Age:** OA is more common in older adults as the cartilage naturally wears down with age.

**Obesity:** Excess weight puts stress on the joints, especially the knees and hips, which can lead to OA.

**Genetics:** Some people are more likely to develop OA if they have a family history of the condition.

**Joint injury:** A previous joint injury, such as a fracture or dislocation, can increase the risk of developing OA in that joint.

**Repetitive motion:** Jobs or activities that involve repetitive motion can put stress on the joints and lead to OA.

**Muscle weakness:** Weak muscles can put extra stress on the joints, increasing the risk of OA.

**Sex:** Women are more likely to develop OA than men, especially after menopause.

**Certain medical conditions:** Some medical conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, and rheumatoid arthritis, can increase the risk of OA.","Osteoarthritis often results from years of wear and tear on joints. This wear and tear mostly affects the cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of bones within the joint. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage begins to fray, wear away, and decay. Putting too much stress on a joint that has been repeatedly injured may lead to the development of osteoarthritis, too. A person who is overweight is more likely to develop osteoarthritis because of too much stress on the joints. Also, improper joint alignment may lead to the development of osteoarthritis."
What are the symptoms of Osteoarthritis ?," Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones wears down over time. It is the most common type of arthritis, and it can affect any joint in the body, but it most commonly affects the knees, hips, spine, hands, and feet.

Symptoms of osteoarthritis may include:

* Joint pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest
* Stiffness in the joints, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity
* Swelling and tenderness around the affected joint
* Creaking or grinding sensation when moving the affected joint
* Loss of flexibility in the affected joint
* Muscle weakness around the affected joint
* Bone spurs (osteophytes) around the affected joint
* Pain that is worse in cold or damp weather

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to see your doctor to get a diagnosis and treatment plan. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to slow the progression of OA and improve your quality of life.","Warning signs of osteoarthritis include -  joint pain  -  swelling or tenderness in one or more joints  -  stiffness after getting out of bed or sitting for a long time  -  a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone.  joint pain swelling or tenderness in one or more joints stiffness after getting out of bed or sitting for a long time a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone. Not everyone with osteoarthritis develops symptoms. In fact, only a third of people with x-ray evidence of osteoarthritis report pain or other symptoms."
How to diagnose Osteoarthritis ?," **1. Physical Examination:**
   - Your doctor will assess your joints for:
     - Pain
     - Swelling
     - Warmth
     - Tenderness
     - Limited range of motion
     - Crepitus (grinding or grating sensation)

**2. Medical History:**
   - Your doctor will ask about:
     - Duration and severity of symptoms
     - Location and frequency of pain
     - Activities that trigger or relieve symptoms
     - Family history of arthritis
     - Past injuries or conditions affecting the joints

**3. X-rays:**
   - These provide detailed images of bones and can show:
     - Joint space narrowing
     - Bone spurs (osteophytes)
     - Cysts or erosions in the bone
     - Alignment issues, such as knock knees or bow legs

**4. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**
   - MRI can provide more detailed images of the soft tissues around the joints, including:
     - Cartilage damage
     - Ligament tears
     - Meniscus tears
     - Bone marrow edema

**5. CT (Computed Tomography) Scan:**
   - CT scans can provide detailed images of the bones and surrounding structures, including:
     - Bone density
     - Alignment issues
     - Fractures

**6. Blood Tests:**
   - Blood tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions, such as:
     - Rheumatoid arthritis
     - Gout
     - Pseudogout
     - Infection

**7. Synovial Fluid Analysis:**
   - In some cases, a sample of synovial fluid (the fluid that lubricates the joints) may be taken to check for:
     - Infection
     - Crystals (indicating gout or pseudogout)
     - Inflammatory markers","No single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. When a person feels pain in his or her joints, it may or may not be osteoarthritis. The doctor will use a combination of tests to try to determine if osteoarthritis is causing the symptoms. These may include a medical history, a physical examination, x-rays, and laboratory tests. A patient's attitudes, daily activities, and levels of anxiety or depression have a lot to do with how much the symptoms of osteoarthritis affect day-to-day living."
What are the treatments for Osteoarthritis ?," Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints. While there is no cure for OA, there are a number of treatments that can help to relieve symptoms and improve function.

**Non-surgical treatments for OA include:**

* **Weight loss:** If you are overweight or obese, losing weight can help to reduce the stress on your joints and improve symptoms of OA.
* **Exercise:** Regular exercise can help to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve flexibility. This can help to reduce pain and stiffness, and improve function.
* **Physical therapy:** Physical therapy can help you to learn exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve flexibility. It can also help you to improve your posture and reduce stress on your joints.
* **Occupational therapy:** Occupational therapy can help you to learn how to perform daily activities in a way that minimizes stress on your joints.
* **Assistive devices:** Assistive devices, such as canes, walkers, and grab bars, can help you to move around more easily and reduce stress on your joints.
* **Medication:** There are a number of medications that can help to relieve pain and inflammation associated with OA. These include over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, as well as prescription medications, such as opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids.

**Surgical treatments for OA include:**

* **Arthroscopy:** Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that can be used to remove damaged tissue and repair cartilage in the joint.
* **Osteotomy:** Osteotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the bone around the joint to realign it and reduce stress on the damaged cartilage.
* **Joint replacement:** Joint replacement is a surgical procedure that involves removing the damaged joint and replacing it with an artificial joint.

The type of treatment that is best for you will depend on the severity of your OA, your age, and your activity level. Talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for you.","Warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower can provide temporary pain relief. Medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, help reduce pain and inflammation that result from osteoarthritis. A doctor or physical therapist can recommend if heat or cold is the best treatment. For osteoarthritis in the knee, wearing insoles or cushioned shoes may reduce joint stress."

* **Assistive devices:** Assistive devices, such as canes, crutches, or walkers, can help to reduce stress on your joints and improve mobility.
* **Heat and cold therapy:** Heat and cold therapy can help to relieve pain and stiffness. Heat can be applied to the affected joint using a heating pad, hot water bottle, or warm bath. Cold can be applied to the affected joint using an ice pack or cold compress.
* **Over-the-counter pain relievers:** Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help to relieve pain and inflammation.
* **Prescription pain relievers:** Prescription pain relievers, such as opioids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be necessary to relieve severe pain.
* **Corticosteroid injections:** Corticosteroid injections can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain.
* **Hyaluronic acid injections:** Hyaluronic acid injections can help to lubricate the joint and relieve pain.
* **Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy:** PRP therapy involves injecting the affected joint with a concentration of platelets from your own blood. This can help to promote healing and reduce pain.

**Surgical treatments for OA include:**

* **Arthroscopy:** Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that involves using a small camera to visualize the inside of the joint. During arthroscopy, the surgeon can remove damaged tissue, repair cartilage, and relieve pain.
* **Osteotomy:** Osteotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting and realigning the bones around the affected joint. This can help to relieve pain and improve function.
* **Joint replacement:** Joint replacement is a surgical procedure that involves replacing the damaged joint with an artificial joint. This is typically the last resort for OA, but it can be a very effective way to relieve pain and improve function.","People with osteoarthritis may find many non-drug ways to relieve pain. Below are some examples. Heat and cold.  Heat or cold (or a combination of the two) can be useful for joint pain. Heat can be applied in a number of different ways -- with warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower -- to increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness. In some cases, cold packs (bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel), which reduce inflammation, can relieve pain or numb the sore area. (Check with a doctor or physical therapist to find out if heat or cold is the best treatment.) Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). TENS is a technique that uses a small electronic device to direct mild electric pulses to nerve endings that lie beneath the skin in the painful area. TENS may relieve some arthritis pain. It seems to work by blocking pain messages to the brain and by modifying pain perception. Massage.  In this pain-relief approach, a massage therapist will lightly stroke and/or knead the painful muscles. This may increase blood flow and bring warmth to a stressed area. However, arthritis-stressed joints are sensitive, so the therapist must be familiar with the problems of the disease. Acupuncture.  Some people have found pain relief using acupuncture, a practice in which fine needles are inserted by a licensed acupuncture therapist at specific points on the skin. Scientists think the needles stimulate the release of natural, pain-relieving chemicals produced by the nervous system. A large study supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) revealed that acupuncture relieves pain and improves function in knee osteoarthritis, and it serves as an effective complement to standard care. Nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, have been reported to improve the symptoms of people with osteoarthritis, as have certain vitamins. Additional studies have been carried out to further evaluate these claims. It is unknown whether they might change the course of disease. Folk remedies  include the wearing of copper bracelets, following special diets, and rubbing WD-40 on joints to lubricate them. Although these practices may or may not be harmful, no scientific research to date shows that they are helpful in treating osteoarthritis. They can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. For general information about alternative therapies, see the Complementary Health Approaches  topic."

* **Joint replacement surgery:** Joint replacement surgery is a more invasive surgical procedure that involves removing the damaged joint and replacing it with an artificial joint.

The best treatment for OA will depend on the severity of your symptoms and your individual needs. Talk to your doctor about which treatment options are right for you.","Doctors consider a number of factors when choosing medicines for their patients. In particular, they look at the type of pain the patient may be having and any possible side effects from the drugs. For pain relief, doctors usually start with acetaminophen because the side effects are minimal. If acetaminophen does not relieve pain, then non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen may be used. Some NSAIDs are available over the counter, while more than a dozen others, including a subclass called COX-2 inhibitors, are available only with a prescription. Corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and topical creams are also used. Most medicines used to treat osteoarthritis have side effects, so it is important for people to learn about the medicines they take. For example, people over age 65 and those with any history of ulcers or stomach bleeding should use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, with caution. There are measures you can take to help reduce the risk of side effects associated with NSAIDs. These include taking medications with food and avoiding stomach irritants such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. In some cases, it may help to take another medication along with an NSAID to coat the stomach or block stomach acids. Although these measures may help, they are not always completely effective. For more tips on how older adults can avoid medication side effects, see Side Effects in the Taking Medicines topic."

After surgery and rehabilitation, the patient usually feels less pain and swelling and can move more easily."
What is (are) Problems with Taste ?," There are several problems that can affect taste. Some of the most common include:

- **Ageusia:** This is a complete loss of taste. It can be caused by damage to the taste buds or to the nerves that carry taste signals to the brain.
- **Hypogeusia:** This is a partial loss of taste. It can be caused by the same things that cause ageusia, as well as by certain medications, smoking, and radiation therapy.
- **Dysgeusia:** This is a distortion of taste. It can be caused by damage to the taste buds, by certain medications, or by certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and thyroid disease.
- **Hypergeusia:** This is an increased sensitivity to taste. It can be caused by damage to the taste buds or by certain medical conditions, such as pregnancy and certain medications.
- **Phantogeusia:** This is the experience of tasting something when nothing is actually there. It can be caused by damage to the taste buds, by certain medications, or by certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.","Taste, or gustation, is one of our most robust senses. Although there is a small decline in taste in people over 60, most older people will not notice it because normal aging does not greatly affect our sense of taste. Problems with taste occur less frequently than problems with smell. How Our Sense of Taste Works Our sense of taste, along with our sense of smell, is part of our chemical sensing system. Normal taste occurs when tiny molecules released by chewing or the digestion of food stimulate special sensory cells in the mouth and throat. These taste cells, or gustatory cells, send messages through three specialized taste nerves to the brain, where specific tastes are identified. Damage to these nerves following head injury can lead to taste loss. The taste cells are clustered within the taste buds of the tongue and roof of the mouth, and along the lining of the throat. Many of the small bumps that can be seen on the tip of the tongue contain taste buds. At birth, we have about 10,000 taste buds scattered on the back, sides, and tip of the tongue. After age 50, we may start to lose taste buds. Five Taste Sensations We can experience five basic taste sensations: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, or savory. Umami is the taste we get from glutamate, a building block of protein found in chicken broth, meat stock, and some cheeses. Umami is also the taste associated wtih MSG (monosodium glutamate) that is often added to foods as a flavor enhancer. The five taste qualities combine with other oral sensations, such as texture, spiciness, temperature, and aroma to produce what is commonly referred to as flavor. It is flavor that lets us know whether we are eating an apple or a pear. Flavors and the Sense of Smell Many people are surprised to learn that we recognize flavors largely through our sense of smell. Try holding your nose while eating chocolate. You will be able to distinguish between its sweetness and bitterness, but you can't identify the chocolate flavor. That's because the distinguishing characteristic of chocolate is largely identified by our sense of smell as aromas are released during chewing. Food flavor is affected by a head cold or nasal congestion because the aroma of food does not reach the sensory cells that detect odors. More information on this topic can be found in the topic Problems With Smell  Smell and Taste Closely Linked Smell and taste are closely linked senses. Many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste, when they are really experiencing a problem with smell. It is common for people who lose their sense of smell to say that food has lost its taste. This is incorrect; the food has lost its aroma, but taste remains. In older people, there is a normal decline in the sense of smell and the taste of food shifts toward blandness. This is why people often believe they have a taste problem. When Taste is Impaired Problems with taste can have a big impact on an older person's life. Because taste affects the amount and type of food we eat, when there are problems with taste, a person may change his or her eating habits. Some people may eat too much and gain weight, while others may eat too little and lose weight. A loss of appetite, especially in older adults, can lead to loss of weight, poor nutrition, weakened immunity, and even death. Taste helps us detect spoiled food or liquids and it also helps some people detect ingredients they are allergic to. A problem with taste can weaken or remove an early warning system that most of us take for granted. A distorted sense of taste can be a serious risk factor for illnesses that require sticking to a specific diet. Loss of taste can cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better. This can be a problem for people with such illnesses as diabetes or high blood pressure. In severe cases, loss of taste can lead to depression. Taste Problems Are Often Temporary When an older person has a problem with taste, it is often temporary and minor. True taste disorders are uncommon. When a problem with taste exists, it is usually caused by medications, disease, some cancer treatments, or injury. Many older people believe that there is nothing they can do about their weakened sense of taste. If you think you have a problem with your sense of taste, see your doctor. Depending on the cause of your problem, your doctor may be able to suggest ways to regain your sense of taste or to cope with the loss of taste."
What causes Problems with Taste ?," Problems with taste, also known as dysgeusia, can be caused by a variety of factors, including:

1. **Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions can affect taste perception, such as:

   - **Sinus Infections and Allergies:** Congestion and inflammation in the nasal passages can interfere with the sense of smell, which is closely linked to taste.
   - **Dental Problems:** Poor oral hygiene, gum disease, and dental infections can alter taste perception.
   - **Diabetes:** High blood sugar levels can damage nerves and affect taste buds.
   - **Thyroid Disorders:** Thyroid hormone imbalances can alter taste perception.
   - **Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies:** Deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals, such as zinc, vitamin A, and vitamin B12, can impact taste.
   - **Medications:** Some medications, such as antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and certain antidepressants, can cause taste disturbances as a side effect.
   - **Neurological Disorders:** Conditions that affect the brain or nerves, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, can alter taste perception.
   - **Head Injuries:** Traumatic brain injuries can damage taste-related structures in the brain.
   - **COVID-19:** Loss of taste and smell is a common symptom of COVID-19 infection.

2. **Aging:** As people age, their taste buds may gradually decline in number and function, leading to a diminished sense of taste.

3. **Smoking:** Smoking can damage taste buds and impair taste perception.

4. **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol consumption can damage taste buds and affect taste.

5. **Exposure to Chemicals:** Exposure to certain chemicals, such as those found in cleaning products, pesticides, and industrial solvents, can temporarily or permanently alter taste perception.

6. **Radiation Therapy:** Radiation therapy used in cancer treatment can damage taste buds and cause taste disturbances.

7. **Dry Mouth:** Conditions that cause dry mouth, such as certain medications, dehydration, and Sjögren's syndrome, can affect taste perception.

It's important to note that taste disturbances can sometimes be a sign of a more serious underlying medical condition. If you experience persistent or severe problems with taste, it's recommended to consult a healthcare professional for evaluation and proper management.","Loss of taste may be permanent or temporary, depending on the cause. As with vision and hearing, people gradually lose their ability to taste as they get older, but it is usually not as noticeable as loss of smell. Medications and illness can make the normal loss of taste worse. Common Causes Problems with taste are caused by anything that interrupts the transfer of taste sensations to the brain, or by conditions that affect the way the brain interprets the sensation of taste. Some people are born with taste disorders, but most develop them after an injury or illness. Among the causes of taste problems are - medications   - upper respiratory and middle ear infections   - radiation for treatment of head and neck cancers  - exposure to certain chemicals   - head injury   - some surgeries  - poor oral hygiene and dental problems  - smoking. medications upper respiratory and middle ear infections radiation for treatment of head and neck cancers exposure to certain chemicals head injury some surgeries poor oral hygiene and dental problems smoking. In many cases, people regain their sense of taste when they stop taking medications or when the illness or injury clears up. Medications.Taking medications can affect our ability to taste. Some antibiotics and antihistamines as well as other medications can cause a bad taste in the mouth or a loss of taste. One type of taste disorder is characterized by a persistent bad taste in the mouth, such as a bitter or salty taste. This is called dysgeusia and it occurs in older people, usually because of medications or oral health problems. Upper Respiratory and Middle Ear Infections. Respiratory infections such as the flu can lead to taste disorders.  Radiation for Head and Neck Cancers.  People with head and neck cancers who receive radiation treatment to the nose and mouth regions commonly experience problems with their sense of smell and taste as an unfortunate side effect. Older people who have lost their larynx or voice box commonly complain of poor ability to smell and taste.  Exposure to Certain Chemicals.  Sometimes exposure to certain chemicals, such as insecticides and solvents, can impair taste. Avoid contact with these substances, and if you do come in contact with them and experience a problem, see your doctor. Head Injury.  Previous surgery or trauma to the head can impair your sense of taste because the taste nerves may be cut, blocked or physically damaged. Some Surgeries.  Some surgeries to the ear nose and throat can impair taste. These include third molarwisdom toothextraction and middle ear surgery. Poor Oral Hygiene and Dental Problems.  Gum disease can cause problems with taste and so can can dentures and inflammation or infections in the mouth. If you take several medications, your mouth may produce less saliva. This causes dry mouth, which can make swallowing and digestion difficult and increase dental problems. Practice good oral hygiene, keep up to date with your dental appointments, and tell your dentist if you notice any problems with your sense of taste. Smoking. Tobacco smoking is the most concentrated form of pollution that most people are exposed to. Smokers often report an improved sense of taste after quitting. When To See the Doctor Be sure to see your doctor if you have had a taste problem for a while or if you notice that your problem with taste is associated with other symptoms. Let your doctor know if you are taking any medications that might affect your sense of taste. You may be able to change or adjust your medicine to one that will not cause a problem with taste. Your doctor will work with you to get the medicine you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects."
What are the symptoms of Problems with Taste ?," Problems with taste can manifest in a variety of ways, affecting the ability to perceive different flavors and tastes in food and beverages. Some of the most common symptoms include:

1. **Ageusia:** Complete loss of taste.

2. **Hypogeusia:** Reduced ability to taste, resulting in a diminished perception of flavors and tastes.

3. **Dysgeusia:** Altered perception of taste, which can lead to distortions in how foods and drinks taste. This may involve experiencing bitter, metallic, or unusual flavors even when consuming something that is normally flavorful.

4. **Phantogeusia:** Experiencing phantom tastes or perceiving tastes that are not actually present. This can occur spontaneously or in response to certain stimuli, such as consuming specific foods or beverages.

5. **Salty Taste in the Mouth:** A persistent salty taste in the mouth that is unrelated to the food consumed.

6. **Metallic Taste in the Mouth:** A persistent metallic taste that can be present even when nothing is being eaten or drunk.

7. **Bitter Taste in the Mouth:** A continuous bitter taste that is not associated with consuming bitter foods.

8. **Sour Taste in the Mouth:** A persistent sour taste that is unrelated to the food or beverages consumed.

9. **Loss of Sweet Taste:** Difficulty perceiving sweet flavors, which may result in foods tasting bland or lacking sweetness.

10. **Loss of Sour Taste:** Reduced ability to detect sour flavors, leading to foods tasting less acidic or tangy.

11. **Loss of Bitter Taste:** Impaired perception of bitter flavors, which may cause certain foods to taste less intense or flavorful.

12. **Difficulty Differentiating Flavors:** Difficulty distinguishing between different flavors, resulting in a reduced ability to discern individual tastes in food.

13. **Food Tasting Bland or Flavorless:** A general lack of flavor perception, leading to foods tasting bland or muted in taste.

It's important to note that problems with taste can be temporary or long-lasting and can have various underlying causes, including medical conditions, certain medications, aging, smoking, and injuries to the taste buds. If you experience any persistent or significant problems with taste, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional for evaluation and proper management of the underlying cause.","Symptoms Vary With Disorders There are several types of taste disorders depending on how the sense of taste is affected. People who have taste disorders usually lose their ability to taste or can no longer perceive taste in the same way. True taste disorders are rare. Most changes in the perception of food flavor result from the loss of smell.  Phantom Taste Perception. The most common taste complaint is ""phantom taste perception"" -- tasting something when nothing is in the mouth.  Hypogeusia. Some people have hypogeusia, or the reduced ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and savory, or umami. This disorder is usually temporary. Dysgeusia. Dysgeusia is a condition in which a foul, salty, rancid, or metallic taste sensation will persist in the mouth. Dysgeusia is sometimes accompanied by burning mouth syndrome, a condition in which a person experiences a painful burning sensation in the mouth. Although it can affect anyone, burning mouth syndrome is most common in middle-aged and older women.  Ageusia. Other people can't detect taste at all, which is called ageusia. This type of taste disorder can be caused by head trauma; some surgical procedures, such as middle ear surgery or extraction of the third molar; radiation therapy; and viral infections. Why a Diagnosis Is Important If you think you have a taste disorder, see your doctor. Loss of the sense of taste can lead to depression and a reduced desire to eat. Loss of appetite can lead to loss of weight, poor nutrition and weakened immunity. In some cases, loss of taste can accompany or signal conditions such as diabetes. Sometimes, a problem with taste can be a sign of a disease of the nervous system, such multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, or Parkinsons disease. Do You Have a Taste Disorder? If you think you have a taste disorder, try to identify and record the circumstances surrounding it. Ask yourself the following questions: - When did I first become aware of it?  - What changes in my taste do I notice?  - Do all foods and drinks taste the same?  - Have there been any changes in my sense of smell?  - Does the change in taste affect my ability to eat normally?  -  What medications do I take? What are the names of the medications? How much do I take? What is the health condition for which I take them?   -  Have I recently had a cold or the flu? When did I first become aware of it? What changes in my taste do I notice? Do all foods and drinks taste the same? Have there been any changes in my sense of smell? Does the change in taste affect my ability to eat normally? What medications do I take? What are the names of the medications? How much do I take? What is the health condition for which I take them? Have I recently had a cold or the flu? Talking With Your Doctor Bring this information with you when you visit the doctor. He or she may refer you to an otolaryngologist, a specialist in diseases of the ear, nose, and throat. An accurate assessment of your taste loss will include, among other things - a physical examination of your ears, nose, and throat   - a dental examination and assessment of oral hygiene  - a review of your health history  - a taste test supervised by a health care professional. a physical examination of your ears, nose, and throat a dental examination and assessment of oral hygiene a review of your health history a taste test supervised by a health care professional. Tests for Taste Disorders Some tests are designed to measure the lowest concentration of a substance that a person can detect or recognize. Your doctor may ask you to compare the tastes of different substances or to note how the intensity of a taste grows when a substance's concentration is increased. Scientists have developed taste tests in which the patient responds to different concentrations of a substance. This may involve a simple ""sip, spit, and rinse"" test or the application of a substance directly to your tongue using an eye dropper. By using these tests, your doctor can determine if you have a true taste disorder and what type it is. If your doctor suspects that nerves in your mouth or head may be affected, he or she may order an X-ray, usually a CAT scan, to look further into the head and neck area. Once the cause of a taste disorder is found, your doctor may be able to treat it. Many types of taste disorders are reversible, but if not, counseling and self-help techniques may help you cope."
What are the treatments for Problems with Taste ?," Treatment for problems with taste depends on the underlying cause. Some common treatments include:

1. Medical Treatment:

For taste disorders caused by medical conditions like infections or medications, treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause. Antibiotics may be prescribed for infections, and medication adjustments can be made if certain drugs are causing taste disturbances.

2. Zinc Supplementation:

Zinc deficiency is a common cause of taste problems. Zinc supplements can be prescribed to restore normal taste function.

3. Taste Retraining:

Taste retraining is a therapy used for味覚障害caused by nerve damage or dysfunction. It involves repeated exposure to specific tastes to help the brain relearn how to interpret taste signals.

4. Lifestyle Modifications:

Certain lifestyle changes can improve taste function, such as:
- Maintaining good oral hygiene
- Avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption
- Limiting exposure to certain chemicals and toxins
- Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains

5. Medications:

In some cases, medications may be prescribed to stimulate or enhance taste perception. These might include corticosteroids for nerve-related taste disorders or medications to reduce inflammation.

6. Surgery:

Surgical intervention may be necessary for conditions like tumors or anatomical abnormalities that affect the taste buds or taste pathways.

7. Artificial Saliva:

Dry mouth, caused by conditions like Sjögren's syndrome or certain medications, can lead to taste problems. Artificial saliva can help restore moisture in the mouth and improve taste perception.

8. Nerve Repair:

In cases where nerve damage is severe and irreversible, nerve repair techniques may be considered.

9. Alternative Medicine:

Some individuals find relief from taste disorders through alternative medicine practices like acupuncture, herbal remedies, or dietary supplements. However, it's important to consult a healthcare professional before trying any alternative therapies.

It's important to consult a doctor or a specialist, such as an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) or a neurologist, to determine the underlying cause of taste problems and receive appropriate treatment.","Relief Is Possible Although there is no treatment for any gradual loss of taste that occurs with aging, relief from taste disorders is possible for many older people. Depending on the cause of your problem with taste, your doctor may be able to treat it or suggest ways to cope with it. Scientists are studying how loss of taste occurs so that treatments can be developed. Some patients regain their sense of taste when the condition or illness that is causing the loss of taste is over. For example, a middle ear infection often affects taste temporarily. Often, correcting the general medical problem can restore the sense of taste. Check Your Medications Often, a certain medication is the cause of a taste disorder, and stopping or changing the medicine may help eliminate the problem. If you take medications, ask your doctor if they can affect your sense of taste. If so, ask if you can take other medications or safely reduce the dose. Do not stop taking your medications unless directed by your doctor. Your doctor will work with you to get the medicines you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects. If Your Diet Is Affected Because your sense of taste may gradually decline, you may not even notice the change. But your diet may change, and not for the better. You may lose interest in food and eat less, but you may choose foods that are high in fat and sugars. Or, you may eat more than you should, hoping to get more flavor from every bite. If you lose some or all of your sense of taste, there are things you can do to make your food taste better: - Prepare foods with a variety of colors and textures  - Use aromatic herbs and hot spices to add more flavor; however avoid adding more sugar or salt to food   - If your diet permits, use small amounts of cheese, bacon bits, or butter on vegetables, as well as olive oil or toasted nuts  - Avoid combination dishes, such as casseroles, that can hide individual flavors and dilute taste.

If Your Sense of Taste Does Not Return If you cannot regain your sense of taste, there are things you can do to ensure your safety. Take extra care to avoid food that may have spoiled. If you live with other people, ask them to smell and taste food to make sure it is fresh. People who live alone should discard food if there is a chance it is spoiled. For those who wish to have additional help, there may be support groups in your area. These are often associated with smell and taste clinics in medical school hospitals. Some online bulletin boards also allow people with smell and taste disorders to share their experiences. Not all people with taste disorders will regain their sense of taste, but most can learn to live with it."

These are just a few examples of the ongoing research efforts in the field of taste disorders. The findings from these studies contribute to a better understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and potential treatments for problems with taste.","The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) supports basic and clinical investigations of smell and taste disorders at its laboratories in Bethesda, Md. and at universities and chemosensory research centers across the country. These chemosensory scientists are exploring how to - prevent the effects of aging on taste and smell   -  develop new diagnostic tests  -  understand associations between taste disorders and changes in diet and food preferences in the elderly or among people with chronic illnesses  - improve treatment methods and rehabilitation strategies.  prevent the effects of aging on taste and smell develop new diagnostic tests understand associations between taste disorders and changes in diet and food preferences in the elderly or among people with chronic illnesses improve treatment methods and rehabilitation strategies. Studies on Aging and Taste A recent NIDCD-funded study has shown that small variations in our genetic code can raise or lower our sensitivity to sweet tastes, which might influence a persons desire for sweets. Scientists have also made progress in understanding how our sense of taste changes as we age. Older adults often decide what to eat based on how much they like or dislike certain tastes. Scientists are looking at how and why this happens in order to develop more effective ways to help older people cope better with taste problems. Studies on Taste Receptors Some of the most recent chemosensory research focuses on identifying the key receptors expressed by our taste cells and understanding how those receptors send signals to the brain. Researchers are also working to develop a better understanding of how sweet and bitter substances attach to their targeted receptors. This research holds promise for the development of sugar or salt substitutes that could help combat obesity or hypertension, as well as the development of bitter blockers that could make life-saving medicines more acceptable to children. Taste cellsas well as sensory cells that help us smellare the only sensory cells in the human body that are regularly replaced throughout life. Researchers are exploring how and why this happens so that they might find ways to replace other damaged sensory cells. Gut and Sweet Receptors Scientists are gaining a better understanding of why the same receptor that helps our tongue detect sweet taste can also be found in the human gut. Recent research has shown that the sweet receptor helps the intestine to sense and absorb sugar and turn up the production of blood sugar-regulation hormones, including the hormone that regulates insulin release. Further research may help scientists develop drugs targeting the gut taste receptors to treat obesity and diabetes. Effects of Medications on Taste Scientists are also working to find out why some medications and medical procedures can have a harmful effect on our senses of taste and smell. They hope to develop treatments to help restore the sense of taste to people who have lost it."

You might feel anxious when faced with a problem at work, before taking a test, or making an important decision. However, anxiety disorders involve more than temporary worry or fear. For a person with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time. These feelings can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships. (Watch the video to learn about the types of anxiety disorders.

Anxiety Disorders in Older Adults Studies estimate that anxiety disorders affect up to 15 percent of older adults in a given year. More women than men experience anxiety disorders. They tend to be less common among older adults than younger adults. But developing an anxiety disorder late in life is not a normal part of aging. Anxiety disorders commonly occur along with other mental or physical illnesses, including alcohol or substance abuse, which may mask anxiety symptoms or make them worse. In older adults, anxiety disorders often occur at the same time as depression, heart disease, diabetes, and other medical problems. In some cases, these other problems need to be treated before a person can respond well to treatment for anxiety. There are three types of anxiety disorders discussed here. - generalized anxiety disorder  - social phobia  - panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder social phobia panic disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) All of us worry about things like health, money, or family problems.

How to diagnose Anxiety Disorders ?," Anxiety disorders are a group of mental illnesses that cause excessive worry, fear, and anxiety. They are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting about 40 million adults every year.

There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): This is a chronic condition that causes excessive worry and anxiety about a variety of things.
Panic disorder: This is a condition that causes sudden, unexpected panic attacks.
Social anxiety disorder: This is a condition that causes intense fear of social situations.
Specific phobias: These are intense fears of specific objects or situations.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): This is a condition that can develop after a person has experienced a traumatic event.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): This is a condition that causes unwanted thoughts and behaviors.

Anxiety disorders can be diagnosed by a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. The diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms and a physical exam. The mental health professional may also ask about the person's family history of mental illness.

There are a number of treatments available for anxiety disorders, including therapy, medication, and self-help strategies. Therapy can help people learn how to manage their anxiety and develop coping skills. Medication can also be helpful in reducing anxiety symptoms. Self-help strategies include exercise, relaxation techniques, and eating a healthy diet.

If you think you may have an anxiety disorder, it is important to see a mental health professional for diagnosis and treatment.","Anxiety disorders sometimes run in families, but no one knows for sure why some people have them while others don't. Anxiety disorders are more common among younger adults than older adults, and they typically start in early life. However, anyone can develop an anxiety disorder at any time. Below are risk factors for these anxiety disorders. - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  -  Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)  - Panic Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) Panic Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder - Risk Factors Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) affects about 6.8 million American adults, including twice as many women as men. The disorder develops gradually and can begin at any point in the life cycle, although the years of highest risk are between childhood and middle age. The average age of onset is 31 years old. Social Phobia - Risk Factors Social phobia affects about 15 million American adults. Women and men are equally likely to develop the disorder, which usually begins in childhood or early adolescence. There is some evidence that genetic factors are involved. Panic Disorder - Risk Factors Panic disorder affects about 6 million American adults and is twice as common in women as men. Panic attacks often begin in late adolescence or early adulthood, but not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder. Many people have just one attack and never have another. The tendency to develop panic attacks appears to be inherited. Diagnosis Can Be Difficult There are a number of reasons why it can be difficult to accurately diagnose an anxiety disorder in older adults. - Anxiety disorders among older adults frequently occur at the same time as other illnesses such as depression, diabetes, heart disease, or a number of other medical illnesses. Problems with cognition (thinking) and changes in life circumstances can also complicate matters. Sometimes the physical signs of these illnesses can get mixed up with the symptoms of anxiety, making it difficult to determine if a person has a true anxiety disorder. For instance, a person with heart disease sometimes has chest pain, which can also be a symptom of a panic disorder.

For example, if you fell and broke a hip, you may be justifiably fearful of going out for a while. But that would not mean you have developed an anxiety disorder.

Or, sometimes the side effects of medication can cause anxiety. Also, a disability or a change in lifestyle caused by a medical illness may lead to an anxiety disorder. Muscle tightness, feeling very tense all the time, and difficulty sleeping can also be symptoms of a physical illness or an anxiety disorder, complicating diagnosis.

Diagnosis Here is how these anxiety disorders are diagnosed. - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  - Panic Disorder  - Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Panic Disorder Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) - Diagnosis GAD can be diagnosed once a person worries excessively about a variety of everyday problems for at least 6 months. People with GAD may visit a doctor many times before they find out they have this disorder. They ask their doctors to help them with headaches or trouble falling asleep, which can be symptoms of GAD, but they don't always get the help they need right away. It may take doctors some time to be sure that a person has GAD instead of something else. Social Phobia - Diagnosis A doctor can tell that a person has social phobia if the person has had symptoms for at least 6 months. Social phobia usually starts during youth. Without treatment, it can last for many years or a lifetime. Panic Disorder - Diagnosis People with panic disorder may sometimes go from doctor to doctor for years and visit the emergency room repeatedly before someone correctly diagnoses their condition. This is unfortunate, because panic disorder is one of the most treatable of all the anxiety disorders, responding in most cases to certain kinds of medication or certain kinds of cognitive psychotherapy, which help change thinking patterns that lead to fear and anxiety. If You Have Symptoms Anxiety disorders are treatable. If you think you have an anxiety disorder, talk to your family doctor. Your doctor should do an exam to make sure that another physical problem isn't causing the symptoms. The doctor may refer you to a mental health specialist. You should feel comfortable talking with the mental health specialist you choose. If you do not, seek help elsewhere. Once you find a mental health specialist you are comfortable with, you should work as a team and make a plan to treat your anxiety disorder together. Talk About About Past Treatment People with anxiety disorders who have already received treatment for an anxiety disorder should tell their doctor about that treatment in detail. If they received medication, they should tell their doctor what medication was used, what the dosage was at the beginning of treatment, whether the dosage was increased or decreased while they were under treatment, what side effects may have occurred, and whether the treatment helped them become less anxious. If they received psychotherapy, they should describe the type of therapy, how often they attended sessions, and whether the therapy was useful."

What is (are) Polycystic ovary syndrome ? (Also called: Polycystic ovaries; Polycystic ovary disease; Stein-Leventhal syndrome; Polyfollicular ovarian disease)," Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of multiple small cysts on the ovaries, irregular or absent menstrual periods, excessive androgen (male hormone) levels, and difficulty getting pregnant. Other symptoms may include acne, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), weight gain, insulin resistance, and infertility. PCOS is caused by an imbalance of hormones, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), androgens, and estrogen. The exact cause of this imbalance is unknown, but it is thought to be related to genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices.","Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition in which a woman has an imbalance of female sex hormones. This may lead to changes in the menstrual cycle, cysts in the ovaries, trouble getting pregnant, and other health problems.)"
What causes Polycystic ovary syndrome ? (Also called: Polycystic ovaries; Polycystic ovary disease; Stein-Leventhal syndrome; Polyfollicular ovarian disease)," Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. The exact cause of PCOS is unknown but is thought to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Genetics likely play a significant role, as PCOS tends to run in families. Hormonal imbalances, such as elevated levels of androgens (male hormones), can also contribute to the development of PCOS. Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body does not use insulin effectively, is another factor associated with PCOS. Additionally, certain environmental factors, such as exposure to certain chemicals or toxins, may also play a role in the development of PCOS.","PCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are:  - Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs   - Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women   Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.   In PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid around them. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.   These problems with the release of eggs can contribute to infertility. The other symptoms of this disorder are due to thehormoneimbalances.  Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.)"
What causes Noonan syndrome ?," Noonan syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. This gene is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and mutations in this gene can lead to dysregulation of these processes, ultimately causing the features and symptoms of Noonan syndrome. Additionally, mutations in other genes, such as KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1, have also been linked to Noonan syndrome, but these are less common than PTPN11 mutations.","Noonan syndrome is linked to defects in several genes. Certain proteins involved in growth and development become overactive as a result of these gene changes.  Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. This means only one parent has to pass down the nonworking gene for the child to have the syndrome. However, some cases may not be inherited.)"
What are the complications of Noonan syndrome ?," The complications of Noonan syndrome can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Potential complications include heart defects, such as pulmonary valve stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; feeding difficulties in infancy; short stature; delayed puberty; intellectual disability; vision problems, such as strabismus (crossed eyes) or nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements); hearing loss; dental problems; skin disorders; musculoskeletal problems, such as scoliosis or pectus excavatum (sunken chest); increased risk of bleeding disorders; and an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.","- Buildup of fluid in tissues of body (lymphedema, cystic hygroma)  - Failure to thrive in infants  - Low self-esteem  - Infertility in males if both testes are undescended  - Problems with the structure of the heart  - Short height  - Social problems due to physical symptoms)"
How to prevent Noonan syndrome ?," Noonan syndrome is caused by genetic mutations and cannot be prevented. It is an inherited condition, which means that it is passed down from parents to their children through genes. In most cases, Noonan syndrome is caused by a mutation in the PTPN11 gene, which is responsible for regulating cell growth and development. While specific prevention strategies do not exist, genetic counseling and prenatal testing can provide information and support to families at risk of having a child with Noonan syndrome.",Couples with a family history of Noonan syndrome may want to consider genetic counseling before having children.)
What are the symptoms of Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome ? (Also called: NFNS; Noonan neurofibromatosis syndrome; Neurofibromatosis with Noonan phenotype; Neurofibromatosis)," The symptoms of Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS) can vary widely, but some of the most common symptoms include distinctive facial features such as a broad or triangular-shaped face, low-set ears, and widely spaced eyes; short stature; developmental delays; learning disabilities; heart abnormalities; multiple caf√©-au-lait spots (light brown patches on the skin); multiple neurofibromas (non-cancerous growths of nerve tissue); axillary freckling (freckles in the armpits); and an increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).","What are the signs and symptoms of Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome?

How many people are affected by polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)," Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common genetic disorder that affects approximately 12.5 million people worldwide, making it one of the most prevalent kidney diseases. PKD is characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys, which can lead to a decline in kidney function and eventually kidney failure. The prevalence of PKD varies among different regions and populations, with a higher prevalence reported in certain countries such as the United States and Europe. PKD affects both men and women equally and can occur at any age, although it is more commonly diagnosed in adults between the ages of 30 and 50.","Polycystic kidney disease is a fairly common genetic disorder. It affects about 500,000 people in the United States. The autosomal dominant form of the disease is much more common than the autosomal recessive form. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease affects 1 in 500 to 1,000 people, while the autosomal recessive type occurs in an estimated 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 people.)"
What are the treatments for polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)," Treatment for polycystic kidney disease (PKD) primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Medications like ACE inhibitors or ARBs can help slow the progression of the disease and control blood pressure. Pain management may involve over-the-counter pain relievers or stronger medications prescribed by a doctor. Lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise, and a balanced diet are also essential. In advanced stages of PKD, dialysis or kidney transplantation may be necessary to support kidney function.","These resources address the diagnosis or management of polycystic kidney disease:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Polycystic Kidney Disease, Autosomal Dominant  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Polycystic Kidney Disease, Autosomal Recessive  - Genetic Testing Registry: Polycystic kidney disease 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Polycystic kidney disease 3, autosomal dominant  - Genetic Testing Registry: Polycystic kidney disease, adult type  - Genetic Testing Registry: Polycystic kidney disease, infantile type  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Polycystic kidney disease   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care)"

What is (are) polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)," Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. These cysts can enlarge over time, causing the kidneys to become enlarged and eventually leading to kidney failure. PKD is the most common inherited kidney disease, affecting approximately 1 in 1,000 people worldwide. There are two main types of PKD: autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD). ADPKD is the more common form, accounting for approximately 85% of cases, and it usually develops in adulthood. ARPKD, on the other hand, is less common and typically affects children or young adults.","Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs. Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver.  Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture.  The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD) is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. The signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.)"
What are the genetic changes related to polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)," Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the presence of multiple cysts in the kidneys. It is caused by mutations in several genes, the most common of which are PKD1 and PKD2. PKD1 is located on chromosome 16 and encodes a protein called polycystin-1, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion and signaling. Mutations in PKD1 account for approximately 85% of cases of autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), the most common type of PKD. PKD2 is located on chromosome 4 and encodes a protein called polycystin-2, which is involved in calcium transport and signaling. Mutations in PKD2 account for approximately 15% of cases of ADPKD. Other genes that have been associated with PKD include GANAB, HNF1B, and PKHD1.","Mutations in the PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 genes cause polycystic kidney disease.  Mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; PKD1 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 1, and PKD2 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 2. These genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions are not fully understood. Researchers believe that they are involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The two proteins work together to promote normal kidney development, organization, and function. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene lead to the formation of thousands of cysts, which disrupt the normal functions of the kidneys and other organs. People with mutations in the PKD2 gene, particularly women, typically have a less severe form of the disease than people with PKD1 mutations. The signs and symptoms, including a decline in kidney function, tend to appear later in adulthood in people with a PKD2 mutation.  Mutations in the PKHD1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown; however, the protein likely transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. Researchers have not determined how mutations in the PKHD1 gene lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease.  Although polycystic kidney disease is usually a genetic disorder, a small percentage of cases are not caused by gene mutations. These cases are called acquired polycystic kidney disease. This form of the disorder occurs most often in people with other types of kidney disease who have been treated for several years with hemodialysis (a procedure that filters waste products from the blood).)"
Is polycystic kidney disease inherited ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)," Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. In the autosomal dominant form, which is the most common type, only one copy of the affected gene is needed to cause the condition. This means that if one parent has PKD, each of their children has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. In the autosomal recessive form, both copies of the gene must be affected for the condition to develop. This means that both parents must carry the affected gene in order for their child to have PKD.","Most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. People with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene in each cell. In about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. The rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified.  Polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the PKHD1 gene in each cell. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.)"
What is (are) Celiac disease - nutritional considerations ? (Also called: Gluten-free diet; Gluten sensitive enteropathy - diet; Celiac sprue - diet)," **Celiac disease - nutritional considerations:** Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the consumption of gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Following a strict gluten-free diet is essential for managing the disease and preventing serious complications. This includes avoiding all foods and ingredients that contain gluten, such as bread, pasta, cereals, and baked goods. Careful attention must be paid to food labels and potential sources of hidden gluten, such as sauces, condiments, and processed foods. Alternative gluten-free grains and flours, such as rice, quinoa, and almond flour, can be incorporated into the diet to provide essential nutrients and ensure a balanced diet.","Celiac disease is an immune disorder passed down through families.  Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, or sometimes oats. It may also be found in some medicines. When a person with celiac disease eats or drinks anything containing gluten, the immune system responds by damaging the lining of the intestinal tract. This affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients.  Carefully following a gluten-free diet helps prevent symptoms of the disease.)"
What is (are) Celiac disease - sprue ? (Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy)," Celiac disease or sprue is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It damages the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and anemia. Treatment involves a lifelong gluten-free diet.","Celiac disease is a condition that creates inflammation in the small intestine, and damage in the lining. This prevents important components of food from being absorbed. The damage to the lining of the intestine comes from a reaction to eating gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley,and possibly oats, and in food made from these ingredients.)"
What causes Celiac disease - sprue ? (Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy)," Celiac disease, also known as non-tropical sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When individuals with celiac disease consume gluten, their immune system mistakenly attacks the small intestine, leading to inflammation and damage to the villi, which are small finger-like projections that line the small intestine and are responsible for nutrient absorption. This damage impairs the absorption of essential nutrients, leading to symptoms such as chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, and malabsorption.","The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown. The lining of the intestines have small projections contains areas called villi. These structures help absorb nutrients. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products that contain gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. As a result, the villi are unable absorb nutrients properly. Therefore, a person becomes malnourished, no matter how much food he or she eats.  The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.  People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk for developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Caucasians and persons of European ancestry. Women are affected more often than men.  People with celiac disease are more likely to have:  - Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome  - Addison's disease  - Down syndrome  - Intestinal cancer  - Intestinal lymphoma  - Lactose intolerance  - Thyroid disease  - Type 1 diabetes)"

(Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy)," Complications of Celiac disease may include iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, osteoporosis or osteomalacia, dental enamel defects, an increased risk of certain autoimmune disorders (e.g., type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), dermatitis herpetiformis (an itchy skin rash), peripheral neuropathy, infertility or miscarriage in women, short stature in children, delayed puberty, and an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer (e.g., intestinal lymphoma).","You must carefully continue to follow the gluten-free diet. When untreated, the disease can cause life-threatening complications.  Delaying diagnosis or not following the diet puts you at risk for related conditions such as:  - Autoimmune disorders  - Bone disease (osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, fractures)  - Certain types of intestinal cancer  - Low blood count (anemia)  - Infertility or repeated miscarriage  - Liver disease)"
Do I need to see a doctor for Celiac disease - sprue ? (Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy)," It is important to see a doctor if you suspect you may have celiac disease. Diagnosis involves blood tests and possibly a biopsy of the small intestine. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent serious complications such as malnutrition, anemia, and osteoporosis. Treatment involves adopting a strict gluten-free diet, which means avoiding foods containing wheat, barley, and rye.",Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of celiac disease.)
How to prevent Celiac disease - sprue ? (Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy)," There is currently no definitive way to prevent celiac disease, as the exact cause of the condition is not fully understood. However, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage the symptoms and prevent further damage to the small intestine in individuals who have already been diagnosed with celiac disease. Early diagnosis and adherence to a gluten-free diet are crucial to minimizing the long-term effects of the condition.","Because the exact cause is unknown, there is no known way to prevent the development of celiac disease. However, being aware of the risk factors (such as having a family member with the disorder) may increase your chances of early diagnosis, treatment, and a long, healthy life.)"
Do you have information about Clinitest tablets poisoning (Also called: Urine sugar reagent poisoning; Anhydrous Benedict's reagent poisoning)," **Clinitest tablets poisoning**, also known as urine sugar reagent poisoning or anhydrous Benedict's reagent poisoning, occurs when these chemical tablets, used to test for the presence of glucose (sugar) in urine, are accidentally ingested. The main toxic component in Clinitest tablets is copper sulfate, which can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, it can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and damage to the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. Treatment typically involves supportive care and monitoring of symptoms, with specific antidotes available for copper poisoning.","Summary : Clinitest tablets are used to test how much sugar (glucose) there is in a person's urine. Poisoning occurs from swallowing these tablets.   Clinitest tablets used to be used to check how well a person's diabetes was being controlled. These tablets are rarely used today. They are not meant to be swallowed, but could be taken by accident, since they look like pills.  This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : The poisonous ingredients in Clinitest tablets are:  - Copper sulfate  - Citric acid  - Sodium hydroxide  - Sodium carbonate

Where Found : The poisonous ingredients are found in Clinitest tablets.  Other products may also contain these ingredients.

Symptoms : Symptoms of poisoning from Clinitest tablets are:  - Blood in urine  - Burns and burning pain in the mouth and throat  - Collapse  - Convulsions  - Diarrhea, may be watery or bloody  - Lightheadedness  - Low blood pressure  - No urine output  - Pain during a bowel movement  - Severe abdominal pain  - Throat swelling (causes breathing trouble)  - Vomiting  - Weakness

Home Care : This type of poisoning requires medical help right away.  DO NOT make a person throw up. (They may do so on their own.)  If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.  If the chemical was swallowed, give the person water or orange juice right away. DO NOT give anything to drink if the person is vomiting or has a decreased level of alertness.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:   - Person's age, weight, and condition   - The name of the product   - When it was swallowed   - The amount swallowed

Poison Control : Your local poison centercan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.   The person may receive:  - Additional flushing of the eyes  - Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and ventilator (breathing machine)  - Bronchoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs.  - Chest x-ray to see if there is air leakage into the tissue around the heart and lungs  - Endoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach.  - Fluids through a vein (IV)  - Medicine to treat symptoms and correct the body's electrolyte (body chemical) and acid-base balance

Outlook (Prognosis) : How well someone does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.  Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible. The ultimate outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison was swallowed. Death is possible.  Keep all medicines in child-proof containers and out of the reach of children.)"
What is (are) celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)," Celiac disease, also known as celiac sprue, gluten enteropathy, or simply sprue, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When someone with celiac disease eats gluten, their immune system attacks the small intestine, causing inflammation and damage to the villi, the small finger-like projections that line the small intestine and help absorb nutrients from food. This damage can lead to a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and anemia. In addition, celiac disease can also cause a number of other health problems, including osteoporosis, infertility, and autoimmune disorders.","Celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body.  Celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.  Inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. Neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. This form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form.  Celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin.  Some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. They also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy.  In a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called T-cell lymphoma.)"
How many people are affected by celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)," Celiac disease, also known as celiac sprue, gluten enteropathy, or simply sprue, is a common autoimmune disorder affecting approximately 1% of the global population. This means that around 75 million people worldwide are estimated to have celiac disease. However, due to underdiagnosis and variations in prevalence across different regions, the exact number of affected individuals may be higher. It is more prevalent in certain parts of the world, such as Europe and North America, where the prevalence can reach up to 3%. Celiac disease affects people of all ages, but it is most commonly diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 40.",Celiac disease is a common disorder. Its prevalence has been estimated at about 1 in 100 people worldwide.)
What are the genetic changes related to celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)," The genetic changes related to celiac disease are primarily associated with variations in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, specifically HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These genes encode for specific proteins that play a role in presenting gluten peptides to the immune system. In individuals with celiac disease, the presence of specific HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 variants can increase the risk of developing an immune response to gluten, leading to the characteristic inflammation and damage to the small intestine. Other genetic factors and interactions with non-HLA genes are also believed to contribute to the development of celiac disease, but the association with HLA variants remains the strongest genetic risk factor.","The risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.  The proteins produced from the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes attach (bind) to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQ heterodimer. This complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.  Celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.  Almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease.  It appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.)"
Is celiac disease inherited ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)," Celiac disease has a strong genetic component and is associated with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, specifically HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These genes are inherited from both parents, and individuals who carry both HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 are at an increased risk of developing celiac disease. However, the presence of these genes alone does not guarantee the development of the disease, and other environmental and immunological factors are also believed to play a role in its manifestation.","Celiac disease tends to cluster in families. Parents, siblings, or children (first-degree relatives) of people with celiac disease have between a 4 and 15 percent chance of developing the disorder. However, the inheritance pattern is unknown.)"
What are the treatments for celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)," The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. This means avoiding all foods containing gluten, such as wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. Oats may also be contaminated with gluten and should be avoided unless they are certified gluten-free. Following a gluten-free diet can help to improve symptoms, prevent long-term complications, and promote overall health in individuals with celiac disease.","These resources address the diagnosis or management of celiac disease:  - Beth Israel Deaconess: Celiac Center  - Columbia University Celiac Disease Center  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Celiac Disease  - Genetic Testing Registry: Celiac disease  - Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Celiac Research and Treatment  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Celiac Disease Nutritional Considerations  - North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition: Gluten-Free Diet Guide  - University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care)"
What is (are) myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG)," Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease that affects the communication between nerves and muscles. It is caused by a defect in the transmission of signals from the nerves to the muscles, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. The weakness typically begins in the eye muscles, causing drooping eyelids and double vision, but can eventually spread to other muscles in the body, affecting speech, swallowing, breathing, and movement. The severity of symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening, and the condition can affect people of all ages, although it is most common in young women and older men.","Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications.  People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60. It is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days or weeks of life. This temporary occurrence of symptoms is called transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.)"
What is (are) Celiac Disease ? (Also called: Celiac sprue; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy; Nontropical sprue)," Celiac disease, also known as celiac sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, or nontropical sprue, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. When people with celiac disease eat gluten, it damages their small intestine, leading to a range of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, and anemia. Celiac disease can also cause a number of other health problems, including osteoporosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, and infertility.","Celiac disease is an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine. If you have celiac disease and eat foods with gluten, your immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins and supplements, lip balm, and even the glue on stamps and envelopes.    Celiac disease affects each person differently. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system, or in other parts of the body. One person might have diarrhea and abdominal pain, while another person may be irritable or depressed. Irritability is one of the most common symptoms in children. Some people have no symptoms.    Celiac disease is genetic. Blood tests can help your doctor diagnose the disease. Your doctor may also need to examine a small piece of tissue from your small intestine. Treatment is a diet free of gluten.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)"
Do you have information about Learn about gluten-free diets," A gluten-free diet excludes foods containing gluten, a protein found in grains like wheat, rye, and barley. It's primarily adopted by individuals with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder where consuming gluten damages the small intestine. However, many people choose a gluten-free diet for perceived health benefits despite not having celiac disease. While eliminating gluten may improve digestive symptoms for some, scientific evidence supporting widespread health benefits is limited. Before making significant dietary changes, consult a healthcare professional, especially if you have an underlying medical condition.","Summary : On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.

Reasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.

How it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs  - Beans  - Nuts and seeds  - Dairy products    Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:  - Quinoa  - Amaranth  - Buckwheat  - Cornmeal  - Millet  - Rice    You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.

Off-Limit Foods : When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:  - Wheat  - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)  - Rye  - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)    You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:  - Bulgur  - Couscous  - Durum flour  - Farina  - Graham flour  - Kamut  - Semolina  - Spelt    Note that ""wheat-free"" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy ""gluten-free"" options of:  - Bread and other baked goods  - Pastas  - Cereals  - Crackers  - Beer  - Soy sauce  - Seitan  - Breading  - Battered or deep-fried foods  - Oats  - Processed foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes  - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies  - Some candies, licorice  - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)

The Role of Exercise : A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health.

Health Benefits : People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.  Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.

Possible Health Concerns : Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:  - Calcium  - Fiber  - Folate  - Iron  - Niacin  - Riboflavin  - Thiamin   To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your health care provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.

Ease of Use : Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.

Where to Find More Information : The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaignat celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.  You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:  - Beyond Celiac - www.beyondceliac.org  - The Celiac Disease Foundation - celiac.org   There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.

When to Call Your Doctor : If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your doctor. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.  If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.)"
Who should get Zolmitriptan and why is it prescribed ?," Zolmitriptan is a medication used to treat acute migraines. It is prescribed to individuals who experience severe headaches, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It belongs to a class of drugs called triptans, which are specifically designed to target and block serotonin receptors in the brain, thereby constricting blood vessels and reducing inflammation associated with migraines. Zolmitriptan works by blocking the release of certain chemicals in the brain that cause pain and inflammation. It is usually taken as a tablet or nasal spray, and its effects typically begin within 30 minutes to 2 hours.","Zolmitriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Zolmitriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists.

What is (are) Gluten Sensitivity ? (Also called: Gluten Intolerance)," Gluten sensitivity, also called gluten intolerance or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, is a condition in which people experience symptoms similar to those of celiac disease when they consume gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. However, unlike celiac disease, gluten sensitivity does not cause damage to the small intestine. Symptoms of gluten sensitivity can include abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea or constipation, fatigue, headaches, and joint pain. Treatment for gluten sensitivity involves avoiding gluten-containing foods and adopting a gluten-free diet.","Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins, and supplements. People with gluten sensitivity have problems with gluten. It is different from celiac disease, an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine.    Some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity are similar to celiac disease. They include tiredness and stomachaches. It can cause other symptoms too, including muscle cramps and leg numbness. But it does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease.    Researchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity. If your health care provider thinks you have it, he or she may suggest that you stop eating gluten to see if your symptoms go away. However, you should first be tested to rule out celiac disease.

How should Zolmitriptan be used and what is the dosage ?," Zolmitriptan is a medication used to treat the acute symptoms of a migraine attack. It comes as a tablet, nasal spray, or injection. The recommended dose of Zolmitriptan varies depending on the individual and the severity of their migraines. The usual starting dose is 2.5 mg taken orally or 5 mg as a nasal spray. If needed, a second dose can be taken after 2 hours, up to a maximum of 10 mg in a 24-hour period. Zolmitriptan should be taken as soon as possible after the onset of a migraine attack, but it can also be taken prophylactically to prevent migraines from occurring.","Zolmitriptan comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you take zolmitriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take zolmitriptan, do not take a second tablet without calling your doctor. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of tablets or orally disintegrating tablets you may take in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zolmitriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  You may take your first dose of zolmitriptan in a doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions.  If your doctor has prescribed a dose lower than 2.5 mg, you may use your fingers to break the 2.5-mg tablet on the line that divides it in half. However, you should not break or split the orally disintegrating tablet.  To take the orally disintegrating tablet, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets.

What is (are) Celiac disease - nutritional considerations ? (Also called: Gluten-free diet; Gluten sensitive enteropathy - diet; Celiac sprue - diet)," **Celiac disease - nutritional considerations**

Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, triggers an immune response in the small intestine. This can lead to nutrient deficiencies, as gluten can damage the villi, which are small finger-like projections that line the small intestine and are responsible for absorbing nutrients. As a result, individuals with celiac disease may need to follow a gluten-free diet in order to avoid nutrient deficiencies and maintain optimal health.","Celiac disease is an immune disorder passed down through families.  Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, or sometimes oats. It may also be found in some medicines. When a person with celiac disease eats or drinks anything containing gluten, the immune system responds by damaging the lining of the intestinal tract. This affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients.  Carefully following a gluten-free diet helps prevent symptoms of the disease.)"
What is (are) Celiac disease - sprue ? (Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy)," Celiac disease, also known as sprue, nontropical sprue, gluten intolerance, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When people with celiac disease eat gluten, their immune system attacks the small intestine, causing inflammation and damage to the villi, the small finger-like projections that line the small intestine and help absorb nutrients from food. This damage can lead to a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, anemia, and malnutrition.","Celiac disease is a condition that creates inflammation in the small intestine, and damage in the lining. This prevents important components of food from being absorbed. The damage to the lining of the intestine comes from a reaction to eating gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley,and possibly oats, and in food made from these ingredients.)"
What causes Celiac disease - sprue ? (Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy)," Celiac disease, also known as celiac sprue or non-tropical sprue, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When people with celiac disease eat gluten, their immune system attacks the small intestine, damaging the villi (small finger-like projections that line the small intestine and help absorb nutrients). This damage can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, which can cause a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue.","The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown. The lining of the intestines have small projections contains areas called villi. These structures help absorb nutrients. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products that contain gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. As a result, the villi are unable absorb nutrients properly. Therefore, a person becomes malnourished, no matter how much food he or she eats.  The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.  People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk for developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Caucasians and persons of European ancestry. Women are affected more often than men.  People with celiac disease are more likely to have:  - Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome  - Addison's disease  - Down syndrome  - Intestinal cancer  - Intestinal lymphoma  - Lactose intolerance  - Thyroid disease  - Type 1 diabetes)"
Do you have information about Clinitest tablets poisoning (Also called: Urine sugar reagent poisoning; Anhydrous Benedict's reagent poisoning)," **Clinitest tablets poisoning**, also known as urine sugar reagent poisoning or anhydrous Benedict's reagent poisoning, occurs when these chemical tablets, used to test for the presence of glucose (sugar) in urine, are ingested. Poisoning can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, as well as systemic effects including dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia, and acute kidney injury. Treatment involves supportive care to address symptoms, and monitoring for complications.","Summary : Clinitest tablets are used to test how much sugar (glucose) there is in a person's urine. Poisoning occurs from swallowing these tablets.   Clinitest tablets used to be used to check how well a person's diabetes was being controlled. These tablets are rarely used today. They are not meant to be swallowed, but could be taken by accident, since they look like pills.  This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : The poisonous ingredients in Clinitest tablets are:  - Copper sulfate  - Citric acid  - Sodium hydroxide  - Sodium carbonate

Where Found : The poisonous ingredients are found in Clinitest tablets.  Other products may also contain these ingredients.

Symptoms : Symptoms of poisoning from Clinitest tablets are:  - Blood in urine  - Burns and burning pain in the mouth and throat  - Collapse  - Convulsions  - Diarrhea, may be watery or bloody  - Lightheadedness  - Low blood pressure  - No urine output  - Pain during a bowel movement  - Severe abdominal pain  - Throat swelling (causes breathing trouble)  - Vomiting  - Weakness

Home Care : This type of poisoning requires medical help right away.  DO NOT make a person throw up. (They may do so on their own.)  If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.  If the chemical was swallowed, give the person water or orange juice right away. DO NOT give anything to drink if the person is vomiting or has a decreased level of alertness.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:   - Person's age, weight, and condition   - The name of the product   - When it was swallowed   - The amount swallowed

Poison Control : Your local poison centercan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.   The person may receive:  - Additional flushing of the eyes  - Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and ventilator (breathing machine)  - Bronchoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs.  - Chest x-ray to see if there is air leakage into the tissue around the heart and lungs  - Endoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach.  - Fluids through a vein (IV)  - Medicine to treat symptoms and correct the body's electrolyte (body chemical) and acid-base balance

Outlook (Prognosis) : How well someone does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.  Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible. The ultimate outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison was swallowed. Death is possible.  Keep all medicines in child-proof containers and out of the reach of children.)"
Do you have information about Comprehensive metabolic panel (Also called: Metabolic panel - comprehensive; Chem-20; SMA20; Sequential multi-channel analysis with computer-20; SMAC20; Metabolic panel 20)," A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), also known as a comprehensive metabolic profile, is a group of 14 blood tests that evaluate various aspects of a person's metabolism, including blood sugar, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and protein levels. It provides valuable information about overall health, helps detect underlying medical conditions, and monitors the effectiveness of treatments. The CMP includes tests for glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, total protein, albumin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).","Summary : A comprehensive metabolic panel is a group of blood tests. Theyprovide an overall picture of your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism refers to all the physical and chemical processes in the body that use energy.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the test.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : This test gives your health care provider information about:  - How your kidneys and liver are working  - Blood sugar, cholesterol, and calcium levels  - Sodium, potassium, and chloride levels (called electrolytes)  - Protein levels    Your provider may order this test during a yearly exam or routine checkup.

Normal Results : - Albumin: 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL  - Alkaline phosphatase: 44 to 147 IU/L  - ALT (alanine aminotransferase): 10 to 40 IU/L  - AST (aspartate aminotransferase): 10 to 34 IU/L  - BUN (blood urea nitrogen): 6 to 20 mg/dL  - Calcium: 8.5 to 10.2 mg/dL  - Chloride: 96 - 106 mEq/L  - CO2 (carbon dioxide): 23 to 29 mEq/L  - Creatinine: 0.6 to 1.3 mg/dL  - Glucose : 70 to 100 mg/dL  - Potassium : 3.7 to 5.2 mEq/L  - Sodium: 135 to 145 mEq/L  - Total bilirubin: 0.3 to 1.9 mg/dL  - Total protein: 6.0 to 8.3 g/dL   Normal values for glucose and creatinine can vary with age.   Normal value ranges for all tests may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results can be due to a variety of different medical conditions. These may include kidney failure, breathing problems, and diabetes complications.

Risks : There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling lightheaded  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))"
Do you have information about Learn about gluten-free diets," A gluten-free diet excludes foods containing gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Typically, individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies follow this diet to manage symptoms. It involves consuming naturally gluten-free foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and certain gluten-free grains such as quinoa, rice, buckwheat, and amaranth. Packaged foods must be carefully checked for gluten content, as many processed products contain hidden gluten. Adopting a gluten-free lifestyle may require reading food labels diligently, seeking out specialty gluten-free products, and potentially finding alternative sources for common gluten-containing ingredients like bread, pasta, and baked goods.","Summary : On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.

Reasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.

How it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs  - Beans  - Nuts and seeds  - Dairy products    Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:  - Quinoa  - Amaranth  - Buckwheat  - Cornmeal  - Millet  - Rice    You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.

Off-Limit Foods : When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:  - Wheat  - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)  - Rye  - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)    You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:  - Bulgur  - Couscous  - Durum flour  - Farina  - Graham flour  - Kamut  - Semolina  - Spelt    Note that ""wheat-free"" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy ""gluten-free"" options of:  - Bread and other baked goods  - Pastas  - Cereals  - Crackers  - Beer  - Soy sauce  - Seitan  - Breading  - Battered or deep-fried foods  - Oats  - Processed foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes  - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies  - Some candies, licorice  - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)

The Role of Exercise : A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health.

Health Benefits : People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.  Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.

Possible Health Concerns : Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:  - Calcium  - Fiber  - Folate  - Iron  - Niacin  - Riboflavin  - Thiamin   To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your health care provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.

Ease of Use : Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.

Where to Find More Information : The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaignat celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.  You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:  - Beyond Celiac - www.beyondceliac.org  - The Celiac Disease Foundation - celiac.org   There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.

When to Call Your Doctor : If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your doctor. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.  If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.)"
Do you have information about Low-salt diet (Also called: Low-sodium diet; Salt restriction)," A low-salt diet, also known as a low-sodium diet or salt restriction, aims to reduce the amount of sodium consumed daily. The recommended daily sodium intake for adults is generally around 2,300 milligrams (mg), but a low-salt diet typically restricts it to 1,500 mg or less per day. This diet is often recommended for individuals with high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease, or fluid retention. By limiting sodium intake, it helps control blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart-related complications, and improve overall cardiovascular health.","Summary : Your body needs salt to work properly. Salt contains sodium. Sodium helps your body control many functions. Too much sodium in your diet can be bad for you. For most people, dietary sodium comes from salt that is in or added to their food.   If you have high blood pressure or heart failure, youwill likely be askedto limit how much salt you eat every day. Even people with normal blood pressure will have lower (and healthier) blood pressure if they lower how much salt they eat.   Dietary sodium is measured in milligrams (mg). Your doctor may tell you to eat no more than 2,300 mg a day when you have these conditions. For some people, 1,500 mg a day is an even better goal.

Limiting Salt in Your Diet : Eating a variety of foods every day can help you limit salt. Try to eat a balanced diet.  Buy fresh vegetables and fruits whenever possible. They are naturally low in salt. Canned foods often contain salt to preserve the color of the food and keep it looking fresh. For this reason, it is better to buy fresh foods. Also buy:  - Fresh meats, chicken or turkey, and fish  - Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits    Look for these words on labels:   - Low-sodium   - sodium-free  - No salt added  - Sodium-reduced  - Unsalted    Check all labels for how much salt foods contain per serving.  Ingredients are listed in order of the amount the food contains. Avoid foods that list salt near the top of the list of ingredients. A product with less than 100 mg of salt per serving is good.  Stay away from foods that are always high in salt. Some common ones are:  - Processed foods, such as cured or smoked meats, bacon, hot dogs, sausage, bologna, ham, and salami  - Anchovies, olives, pickles, and sauerkraut  - Soy and Worcestershire sauces, tomato and other vegetable juices, and most cheeses  - Many bottled salad dressings and salad dressing mixes  - Most snack foods, such as chips, crackers, and others    When you cook, replace salt with other seasonings. Pepper, garlic, herbs, and lemon are good choices. Avoid packaged spice blends. They often contain salt.  Use garlic and onion powder, not garlic and onion salt. Do not eat foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG).  When you go out to eat, stick to steamed, grilled, baked, boiled, and broiled foods with no added salt, sauce, or cheese. If you think the restaurant might use MSG, ask them not to add it to your order.  Use oil and vinegar on salads. Add fresh or dried herbs. Eat fresh fruit or sorbet for dessert, when you have dessert. Take the salt shaker off your table. Replace it with a salt-free seasoning mix.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist what antacids and laxatives contain little or no salt, if you need these medicines. Some have a lot of salt in them.  Home water softeners add salt to water. If you have one, limit how much tap water you drink. Drink bottled water instead.  Ask your doctor if a salt substitute is safe for you. Many contain a lot of potassium. This may be harmful if you have certain medical conditions or if you are taking certain medicines. However, if extra potassium in your diet would not be harmful to you, a salt substitute is a good way to lower the amount of sodium in your diet.

What is (are) ring chromosome 20 syndrome ? (Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)," Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder caused by the formation of a ring-shaped chromosome 20. This occurs when the ends of the chromosome break and fuse together, forming a circular structure instead of the usual linear shape. This can lead to various developmental and health problems, including intellectual disability, seizures, distinctive facial features, short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and hearing loss. The severity of the symptoms can vary widely between individuals, depending on the size and location of the deletion or rearrangement within chromosome 20.","Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is a condition that affects the normal development and function of the brain. The most common feature of this condition is recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in childhood. The seizures may occur during the day or at night during sleep. They are described as partial seizures because they affect only one area of the brain, a region called the frontal lobe. In many cases, the seizures are complex and resistant to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. Prolonged seizure episodes known as non-convulsive status epilepticus also appear to be characteristic of ring chromosome 20 syndrome. These episodes involve confusion and behavioral changes.  Most people with ring chromosome 20 syndrome also have some degree of intellectual disability and behavioral difficulties. Although these problems can appear either before or after the onset of epilepsy, they tend to worsen after seizures develop. Additional features of this condition can include slow growth and short stature, a small head (microcephaly), and subtle differences in facial features. Major birth defects are rarely seen with ring chromosome 20 syndrome.)"
How many people are affected by ring chromosome 20 syndrome ? (Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)," Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder that affects approximately 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 50,000 individuals. It is caused by a structural abnormality where the ends of chromosome 20 are joined together to form a ring-like structure. This chromosomal rearrangement can result in a range of symptoms, including intellectual disability, developmental delays, seizures, distinctive facial features, heart defects, hearing loss, and growth problems. The severity of the symptoms can vary from individual to individual, depending on the specific genetic material that is affected within the ring chromosome.","Ring chromosome 20 syndrome appears to be a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown. More than 60 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature.)"
What are the genetic changes related to ring chromosome 20 syndrome ? (Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)," The genetic changes associated with ring chromosome 20 syndrome involve the formation of a ring-shaped chromosome 20. This occurs when the ends of the chromosome break and fuse together, resulting in a circular structure. The ring chromosome 20 can either be inherited from a parent or can occur spontaneously as a new genetic change. Inherited cases may be associated with rearrangements or deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20, leading to the clinical features and symptoms of the syndrome.","Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality known as a ring chromosome 20 or r(20). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 20 syndrome have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.  It is not well understood how the ring chromosome causes the signs and symptoms of this syndrome. In some affected individuals, genes near the ends of chromosome 20 are deleted when the ring chromosome forms. Researchers suspect that the loss of these genes may be responsible for epilepsy and other health problems. However, other affected individuals do not have gene deletions associated with the ring chromosome. In these people, the ring chromosome may change the activity of certain genes on chromosome 20, or it may be unable to copy (replicate) itself normally during cell division. Researchers are still working to determine the precise relationship between the ring chromosome 20 and the characteristic features of the syndrome.)"
Is ring chromosome 20 syndrome inherited ? (Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)," Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is typically not inherited, but rather occurs sporadically due to a chromosomal rearrangement during cell division in the formation of the embryo. It is caused by the formation of a ring-shaped chromosome 20, which results from the loss of genetic material from both ends of the chromosome. Inherited cases, however, can occur if one parent carries a balanced translocation involving chromosome 20, which can increase the risk of having a child with ring chromosome 20 syndrome. Nonetheless, the majority of cases are sporadic and not passed down from parents.","Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is almost never inherited. A ring chromosome typically occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. Often, the ring chromosome is present in only some of a person's cells. This situation is known as mosaicism.  Most affected individuals have no history of the disorder in their families. However, at least one family has been reported in which a ring chromosome 20 was passed from a mother to her children.)"
What are the treatments for ring chromosome 20 syndrome ? (Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)," Treatment for ring chromosome 20 syndrome is symptomatic and supportive, as there is no cure. Medical management may include anticonvulsants to control seizures, medications for behavioral issues, physical therapy to improve motor skills, and occupational therapy to enhance daily living skills. In cases where there is a structural abnormality of the heart or other organs, surgical intervention may be necessary. Long-term monitoring and regular check-ups with specialists are essential for addressing any emerging health concerns and providing appropriate care.",These resources address the diagnosis or management of ring chromosome 20 syndrome:  - Genetic Testing Registry: Ring chromosome 20 syndrome  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Chromosome  - MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Epilepsy   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care)
What is (are) Gluten Sensitivity ? (Also called: Gluten Intolerance)," Gluten sensitivity, also called gluten intolerance or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, is a condition in which people experience symptoms similar to those of celiac disease when they consume gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. However, unlike celiac disease, gluten sensitivity does not cause damage to the small intestine. Symptoms of gluten sensitivity can include abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea or constipation, fatigue, headaches, and joint pain. Treatment for gluten sensitivity involves avoiding gluten-containing foods and adopting a gluten-free diet.","Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins, and supplements. People with gluten sensitivity have problems with gluten. It is different from celiac disease, an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine.    Some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity are similar to celiac disease. They include tiredness and stomachaches. It can cause other symptoms too, including muscle cramps and leg numbness. But it does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease.    Researchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity. If your health care provider thinks you have it, he or she may suggest that you stop eating gluten to see if your symptoms go away. However, you should first be tested to rule out celiac disease.

Do you have information about Sodium (Also called: Salt)," Sodium, also known as salt, is a mineral that is essential for human health. It helps regulate blood pressure, fluid balance, and muscle contractions. Sodium is found naturally in many foods, such as meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, and vegetables. It is also added to many processed foods, such as canned soups, frozen dinners, and snack foods. The recommended daily intake of sodium for adults is 2,300 milligrams (mg). Consuming too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.","Summary : Table salt is made up of the elements sodium and chlorine - the technical name for salt is sodium chloride. Your body needs some sodium to work properly. It helps with the function of nerves and muscles. It also helps to keep the right balance of fluids in your body. Your kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If you have too much and your kidneys can't get rid it, sodium builds up in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to other health problems.    Most people in the U.S. get more sodium in their diets than they need. A key to healthy eating is choosing foods low in salt and sodium. Doctors recommend you eat less than 2.4 grams per day. That equals about 1 teaspoon of table salt a day. Reading food labels can help you see how much sodium is in prepared foods.

What is Phosphate salts ?," Phosphate salts are a type of inorganic compound that contains the phosphate ion, PO43-. These salts are formed by the reaction of a base with phosphoric acid, H3PO4. Phosphate salts are commonly used in a variety of applications, including fertilizers, detergents, and food additives. In fertilizers, phosphate salts provide essential nutrients for plant growth. In detergents, phosphate salts help to soften water and remove dirt and grime. In food additives, phosphate salts are used as preservatives and flavor enhancers.","Phosphate salts refers to many different combinations of the chemical phosphate with salts and minerals. Foods high in phosphate include dairy products, whole grain cereals, nuts, and certain meats. Phosphates found in dairy products and meats seem to be more easily absorbed by the body than phosphates found in cereal grains. Cola drinks contain a lot of phosphate - so much, in fact, that they can cause too much phosphate in the blood.     People use phosphate salts for medicine. Be careful not to confuse phosphate salts with substances such as organophosphates, or with tribasic sodium phosphates and tribasic potassium phosphates, which are very poisonous.     Phosphate salts are taken by mouth for treating blood phosphate levels that are too low and blood calcium levels that are too high, and for preventing kidney stones. They are also taken for treating osteomalacia (often called rickets in children), a condition caused by a mineral imbalance in the body that leads to softening of the bones. Phosphate salts are also used for improving exercise performance, as an antacid for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and as a laxative for emptying the bowels before surgery.     Phosphate salts and calcium are applied to sensitive teeth to reduce pain.     Rectally, phosphate salts are used as a laxative to clean the bowels before surgery or intestinal tests.     Healthcare providers sometimes give potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) for treating low phosphate and high calcium levels in the blood, and for preventing low phosphate in patients who are being tube-fed.)"
How effective is Phosphate salts ?," Phosphate salts, commonly referred to as phosphates, are highly effective in various industrial processes and applications. They serve as key components in the production of fertilizers, detergents, water treatment chemicals, and food additives. In fertilizers, phosphates provide essential phosphorus, a vital nutrient for plant growth, ensuring improved crop yields and agricultural productivity. In detergents, they act as water softeners, enhancing the cleaning performance of soaps and detergents. Phosphates are also used in water treatment to prevent scale formation and corrosion in boilers, cooling towers, and pipelines. Additionally, they find application in food processing as emulsifiers, stabilizers, and texturizing agents, contributing to the quality and shelf life of food products.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.  The effectiveness ratings for PHOSPHATE SALTS are as follows: Effective for...  - Preparing the bowel for a medical procedure. Sodium phosphate tablets (OsmoPrep, Visicol, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Raleigh, NC) are FDA-approved for cleansing the colon before a colonoscopy. Over-the-counter sodium phosphate solutions and enemas may also be used for bowel cleansing before medical procedures.   - Low phosphate levels in the blood. Taking sodium or potassium phosphate by mouth is effective for preventing or treating low phosphate levels in the blood. Intravenous phosphate salts may also treat low phosphate levels in the blood when used under the supervision of a physician.  Likely effective for...  - Constipation. Sodium phosphate is an FDA-permitted over-the-counter (OTC) ingredient for the treatment of constipation. These products are taken by mouth or used as enemas.   - Indigestion. Aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are FDA-permitted ingredients used in antacids.   - High calcium levels in the blood. Taking phosphate salt (except calcium phosphate) by mouth is likely effective for treating high levels of calcium in the blood. But intravenous phosphate salts should not be used.   Possibly effective for...  - Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Taking potassium phosphate by mouth might help prevent calcium kidney stones from forming in patients with high urine levels of calcium.  Possibly ineffective for...  - Athletic performance. Some early research suggests that taking sodium phosphate by mouth four times daily for 6 days might increase athletic performance in male cyclists. However, most evidence shows that taking phosphate salts by mouth does not improve exercise performance.  Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...  - Diabetes complication (diabetic ketoacidosis). Early research suggests that taking potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) does not improve a diabetes complication in which the body produces too many blood acids called ketones. People with this condition should only be given phosphates if they have low phosphate levels.   - Complications that occur upon eating in people who were previously starving (refeeding syndrome). Limited research shows that giving sodium and potassium phosphates intravenously (by IV) over 24 hours prevents refeeding syndrome when restarting nutrition in people who are severely malnourished or starved.    - Sensitive teeth.   - Other conditions.  More evidence is needed to rate phosphate salts for these uses.)"
What is (are) Substance use - amphetamines ? (Also called: Substance abuse - amphetamines; Drug abuse - amphetamines; Drug use - amphetamines)," Substance use - amphetamines refers to the use of amphetamine-type stimulants, which include drugs like methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), and Adderall. These substances can affect the central nervous system, leading to increased alertness, energy, and focus, as well as a sense of euphoria. However, excessive or prolonged use can cause a variety of adverse effects, including addiction, anxiety, paranoia, heart problems, and even psychosis.","Amphetamines are drugs. They can be legal or illegal. They are legal when they are prescribed by a doctor and used to treat health problems such as obesity, narcolepsy, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).   Amphetamines are illegal when they are used without a prescription to get high or improve performance. In this case, they are known as street, or recreational drugs, and using them can lead to addiction. This article describes this aspect of amphetamines.)"
What is (are) Substance use - amphetamines ? (Also called: Substance abuse - amphetamines; Drug abuse - amphetamines; Drug use - amphetamines)," Substance use - amphetamines refers to the use of amphetamine-type stimulants, which include substances like amphetamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA (ecstasy). These substances can be taken orally, injected, snorted, or smoked, and they affect the central nervous system, leading to increased wakefulness, energy, and focus. High doses or prolonged use can cause a range of adverse effects, including anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, cardiovascular problems, seizures, and death. Amphetamines have a high potential for addiction and can lead to dependence, both physically and psychologically. The term ""substance abuse"" or ""drug abuse"" in this context refers to the excessive or compulsive use of these substances, often resulting in harmful consequences on an individual's health, relationships, and overall well-being.","There are different kinds of street amphetamines. Common ones and some of their slang terms are:  - Amphetamine: goey, louee, speed, uppers, whiz  - Dextroamphetamine (ADHD medicine used illegally): dexies, kidi-speed, pep pills, uppers; black beauty (when combined with amphetamine)  - Methamphetamine (crystal solid form): base, crystal, d-meth, fast, glass, ice, meth, speed, whiz, pure, wax  - Methamphetamine (liquid form): leopard's blood, liquid red, ox blood, red speed   Illegal amphetamines come in different forms:  - Pills and capsules  - Powder and paste  - Crystal  - Liquid   They can be used in different ways:  - Swallowed  - Dabbed onto the gums  - Inhaled through the nose (snorted)  - Injected into a vein (shooting up)  - Smoked)"
What are the treatments for Substance use - amphetamines ? (Also called: Substance abuse - amphetamines; Drug abuse - amphetamines; Drug use - amphetamines)," The primary treatment for amphetamine substance use disorder involves behavioral therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and contingency management (CM). CBT helps individuals recognize and modify their thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that contribute to their substance use, while CM uses a system of rewards and consequences to reinforce positive behaviors and discourage drug use. Medications can also be used in conjunction with behavioral therapies, including stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin) or dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) to manage symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that may underlie amphetamine use, as well as medications for co-occurring mental health conditions. In severe cases, medically supervised detoxification may be necessary to manage withdrawal symptoms and ensure patient safety.","Treatment begins with recognizing there is aproblem. Once you decide you want to do something about your drug use, the next step isto gethelp and support.  Treatment programs use behavior modification techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The techniques get you to understand your behaviors and why you use amphetamines. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support you and keep you from going back to using (relapsing).  If you have severe withdrawal symptoms, you may need to stay at a residential treatment program. There, your health and safety can be monitored as you recover.  At this time, there is no medicine that can help reduce the use of amphetamines by blocking their effects, although scientists are researching such medicines.)"
Do I need to see a doctor for Substance use - amphetamines ? (Also called: Substance abuse - amphetamines; Drug abuse - amphetamines; Drug use - amphetamines)," If you or someone you know is struggling with amphetamine use, it is important to seek professional help.

What are the brand names of Amphetamine ?," Amphetamine, a central nervous system stimulant, is marketed under various brand names. The most common brand name for amphetamine is Adderall, which is a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Other brand names for amphetamine include: Dexedrine, ProCentra, Evekeo, and Adzenys XR-ODT. These medications are used to treat various conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, and they are available in different formulations such as tablets, capsules, and orally disintegrating tablets.",- Dyanavel XR  - Evekeo)
How should Amphetamine be used and what is the dosage ?," **Amphetamine is typically used to treat narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).** The usual starting dose for adults with narcolepsy is 5 mg one to three times daily, with a maximum daily dose of 60 mg. For adults with ADHD, the usual starting dose is 5 mg once or twice daily with a maximum daily dose of 40 mg. Amphetamine should be taken orally with or without food, and the dose should be adjusted according to the individual's response.","Amphetamine comes as an tablet (Evekeo) and as an extended-release (long-acting) suspension (Dyanavel XR) to take by mouth. The suspension is usually taken once daily in the morning with or without food. For treatment of ADHD or narcolepsy, the tablet is usually taken with or without food one to three times daily, 4 to 6 hours apart, with the first dose in the morning. For weight loss, the tablet is usually taken 30 to 60 minutes before meals. Amphetamine should not be taken in the late afternoon or evening because it may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amphetamine exactly as directed.  Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.  It is important to use an oral syringe (measuring device) to accurately measure and take your dose of the suspension. Ask your pharmacist for a device if it was not provided. Wash the oral syringe thoroughly after each use.  If you or your child are taking amphetamine for ADHD, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, every 4 to 7 days, depending on the medication. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking amphetamine from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.  If you are taking amphetamine for narcolepsy, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, not more often than once every week. Follow these directions carefully.)"
What should I do if I forget a dose of Amphetamine ?,,"Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.)"
What is (are) Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)," Benign positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common inner ear condition that causes brief episodes of dizziness or vertigo, typically triggered by specific head movements such as rolling over in bed, looking up, or bending over. It occurs when tiny calcium crystals (canaliths) in the inner ear become dislodged and move into incorrect positions, affecting the balance mechanism. BPPV is usually treated with simple repositioning maneuvers performed by a healthcare professional to help the crystals return to their proper place, resolving the symptoms.",Benign positional vertigo is the most common type of vertigo. Vertigo is the feeling that you are spinning or that everything is spinning around you. It may occur when you move your head in a certain position.)
What causes Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)," Benign positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common inner ear disorder that causes brief episodes of dizziness or vertigo triggered by specific head movements, such as lying down, rolling over in bed, or looking up. It occurs when tiny calcium carbonate crystals (canaliths) that are normally found in the inner ear become dislodged and move into the fluid-filled canals of the inner ear, where they can interfere with the body's natural balance system. This condition is often associated with aging but can also result from head injuries or other underlying medical conditions.","Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis)"
What are the symptoms of Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)," Symptoms of benign positional vertigo (BPPV) include brief episodes of intense dizziness triggered by specific head movements, such as rolling over in bed or looking up. Additional symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and loss of balance. BPPV is usually diagnosed based on the patient's symptoms and a physical examination, including a Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which involves turning the head and body to specific positions to trigger symptoms.","BPPV symptoms include any of the following:  - Feeling like you are spinning or moving  - Feeling like the world is spinning around you  - Loss of balance  - Nausea and vomiting  - Hearing loss  - Vision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving   The spinning sensation:  - Is usually triggered by moving your head  - Often starts suddenly  - Lasts a few seconds to minutes   Certain positions can trigger the spinning feeling:  - Rolling over in bed  - Tilting your head up to look at something)"
How to diagnose Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)," The diagnosis of Benign positional vertigo (BPPV) is based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. The most common symptom of BPPV is brief episodes of dizziness or vertigo that are triggered by specific head movements, such as lying down, rolling over in bed, or looking up. The physical examination may reveal nystagmus, which is an involuntary rapid movement of the eyes, during certain head maneuvers, such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. BPPV can be further confirmed with video-head impulse testing (vHIT) or rotational chair testing, which are specialized tests that assess the function of the vestibular system.","Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history.  To diagnose BPPV, your provider may perform a test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.  - Your provider holds your head in a certain position. Then you are asked to lie quickly backward over a table.  - As you do this, your provider will look for abnormal eye movements and ask if you feel like you are spinning.    If this test doesn't show a clear result, you may be asked to do other tests.   You may have brain and nervous system (neurological) tests to rule out other causes. These may include:  - Electroencephalogram (EEG)  - Electronystagmography (ENG)  - Head CT  - Head MRI  - Hearing test  - Magnetic resonance angiography of the head  - Warming and cooling the inner ear with water or air to test eye movements. This is called caloric stimulation.)"
What are the treatments for Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)," Benign positional vertigo (BPPV) can be treated with various maneuvers and exercises. The Epley maneuver, Semont maneuver, and Brandt-Daroff exercises are commonly used to reposition the displaced otoconia in the inner ear and alleviate symptoms. These maneuvers involve specific head and body movements performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to manage associated symptoms such as nausea or anxiety. If BPPV persists or is severe, surgical intervention may be considered.","Your provider will teach you how to do a procedure called Epley's maneuver. It can move the small piece of calcium that is floating inside your inner ear. This treatment works best to cure BPPV. Other exercises, such as balance therapy, may help some people.  Some medicines can help relieve spinning sensations:  - Antihistamines  - Anticholinergics  - Sedative-hypnotics   But, these medicines often do not work well for treating vertigo.  Follow instructions on how to take care for yourself at home. To keep your symptoms from getting worse, avoid the positions that trigger it.)"
What is the outlook for Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)," Benign positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common inner ear condition that causes brief episodes of dizziness or vertigo triggered by specific head movements. The prognosis for BPPV is generally excellent, with most people experiencing significant improvement or complete resolution of symptoms within a few weeks to months. Treatment typically involves simple repositioning maneuvers performed by a healthcare professional, which can help to reposition the displaced otoconia crystals within the inner ear and alleviate the symptoms of vertigo. In some cases, additional physical therapy exercises or medications may be recommended to manage persistent symptoms or prevent recurrences.","BPPV is uncomfortable, but it can usually be treated with Epley's maneuver.

By adhering to the recommended aftercare plan, individuals can minimize the risk of symptom recurrence and improve their overall well-being.","Your doctor may have treated your vertigo with the Epley maneuver. These are head movements that correct the inner ear problem that causes BPPV. It usually works quickly.  - For the rest of the day, avoid bending over.  - For several days after treatment, avoid sleeping on the side that triggers symptoms.    Most of the time, treatment will cure BPPV. Sometimes vertigo may return after a few weeks. About half the time, BPPV will come back later on. If this happens, you'll need to be treated again. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that can help relieve spinning sensations. However, these medicines often do not work well for treating vertigo.)"
Do you have information about Positioning your baby for breastfeeding (Also called: Breastfeeding positions; Bonding with your baby)," When positioning your baby for breastfeeding, first ensure both you and your baby are comfortable. Hold your baby close to you, with their head slightly elevated and their body supported. Their nose should be aligned with your nipple, and their mouth should cover the entire areola. Make sure your baby's chin is touching your breast, and their body is turned towards you. Additionally, ensure your baby's arms and legs are free to move comfortably. This position allows your baby to latch properly and nurse effectively while promoting bonding and physical closeness between you and your child.","Summary : Be patient with yourself as you learn to breastfeed. Know that breastfeeding takes practice. Give yourself 2 to 3 weeks to get the hang of it.   Learn how to position your baby to breastfeed. Know how to hold your baby in different positions so your nipples do not get sore and so you empty your breasts of milk.

Breastfeeding Positions : You will be more comfortable nursing if you know how to position your baby on your breast. Find a position that works well for you and your baby. Learn about breastfeeding:  - Attend a breastfeeding class.  - Watch someone else breastfeed.  - Practice with an experienced nursing mother.  - Talk with a lactation consultant. A lactation consultant is an expert in breastfeeding. This person can teach you and your baby how to breastfeed. The consultant can help with positions and offer advice when your baby has trouble sucking.

Types of Breastfeeding Positions : CRADLE HOLD  This hold works best for full-term babies. Some new mothers have trouble guiding the baby's mouth to their breast in this hold. If you have had a cesarean birth (C-section), your baby may put too much pressure on your stomach in this hold.  Here's how to do the cradle hold:  - Sit in a comfortable chair with arm rests or a bed with pillows.  - Hold your baby on your lap, lying on the side so that the face, stomach, and knees are facing you.  - Tuck your baby's lower arm under your arm.  - If you are nursing on the right breast, hold your baby's head in the crook of your right arm. Use your arm and hand to support the neck, back, and bottom.  - Keep your baby's knees snug against your body.  - If your nipple hurts, see if your baby has slipped down and the knees are facing the ceiling instead of being tucked in next to your side. Adjust your baby's position if you need to.    FOOTBALL HOLD  Use the football hold if you had a C-section. This hold is good for babies that have trouble latching on because you can guide their head. Women with large breasts or flat nipples also like the football hold.  - Hold your baby like a football. Tuck the baby under the arm on the same side where you will nurse.  - Hold your baby at your side, under your arm.  - Cradle the back of your baby's head in your hand so the baby's nose is pointing at your nipple. The baby's feet and legs will be pointing back. Use your other hand to support your breast. Gently guide your baby to your nipple.    SIDE LYING POSITION  Use this position if you had a C-section or a hard delivery that makes it hard for you to sit up. You can use this position when you are lying in bed.  - Lie on your side.  - Lie your baby close to you with the baby's face at your breast. Pull your baby in snugly and place a pillow behind your baby's back to prevent backwards rolling.

Take Care of Your Nipples : Your nipples naturally make a lubricant to prevent drying, cracking, or infections. In order to keep your nipples healthy:  - Avoid soaps and harsh washing or drying of your breasts and nipples. This can cause dryness and cracking.  - Rub a little breast milk on your nipple after feeding to protect it. Keep your nipples dry to prevent cracking and infection.  - If you have cracked nipples, apply 100% pure lanolin after feedings.   - Try glycerin nipple pads that can be chilled and placed over your nipples to help soothe and heal cracked or painful nipples.

What is (are) Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)," **Primary Syphilis**

Primary syphilis is the first stage of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It typically begins with a sore or ulcer (chancre) at the site where the bacteria entered the body, usually the genitals, rectum, or mouth. The chancre typically appears within 10-90 days of exposure to the bacteria and may be accompanied by swollen lymph nodes, fever, headache, and fatigue.",Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is most often spread through sexual contact.)
What is the outlook for Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)," Primary syphilis usually resolves spontaneously within 3 to 6 weeks, but without treatment, secondary syphilis will develop in all untreated patients. Secondary syphilis will resolve spontaneously within 2 to 6 weeks but may also relapse. Approximately one-third of untreated patients will develop latent syphilis (lasting for years to decades), and one-third will develop late syphilis; up to 15% of untreated patients develop cardiovascular syphilis, and 5-10% develop neurosyphilis, which commonly manifests as tabes dorsalis or general paresis.","Syphilis can be cured if it is diagnosed early and completely treated.  Secondary syphilis can be cured if it is diagnosed early and treated effectively. Although it usually goes away within weeks, in some cases it may last for up to 1 year. Without treatment, up to one-third of patients will have late complications of syphilis.  Late syphilis may be permanently disabling, and it may lead to death.)"

The primary symptom is a painless sore (chancre) at the site of infection, typically on the genitals, rectum, or mouth. Regional lymph nodes may also become enlarged and tender. If left untreated, the infection progresses to the secondary stage.","- Cardiovascular complications (aortitis and aneurysms)  - Destructive sores of skin and bones (gummas)  - Neurosyphilis  - Syphilitic myelopathy - a complication that involves muscle weakness and abnormal sensations  - Syphilitic meningitis   In addition, untreated secondary syphilis during pregnancy may spread the disease to the developing baby. This is called congenital syphilis.)"
What causes Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)," **Primary syphilis** is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, which is usually transmitted through direct contact with an infected person's sores, usually during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. It can also be spread through blood transfusions, sharing needles, or from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy or childbirth. The primary stage of syphilis typically develops within 10-90 days after exposure, and is characterized by the appearance of a single or multiple painless sores (chancres) at the site of infection, commonly on the genitals, anus, or mouth.","Syphilis is a sexually transmitted, infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.  Syphilis occurs worldwide, most commonly in urban areas. The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men. Young adults ages 15 to 25 are the highest-risk population. People have no natural resistance to syphilis.  Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis).  Syphilis has three stages:  - Primary syphilis  - Secondary syphilis  - Tertiary syphilis (the late phase of the illness)    Secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and congenital syphilis are not seen as often in the United States as they were in the past because of the availability of:  - Free, government-sponsored sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics  - Screening tests for syphilis  - Public education about STIs  - Prenatal screening)"
What are the symptoms of Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)," Primary Syphilis is the first stage of syphilis, caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Symptoms typically develop within 10-90 days after exposure and include a single, painless sore (chancre) at the site of infection, usually on the genitals, rectum, or mouth. The sore is typically round, firm, and has a smooth surface, and it may be accompanied by swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin or other areas. Additional symptoms may include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.","Symptoms of primary syphilis are:  - Small, painless open sore or ulcer (called a chancre) on the genitals, mouth, skin, or rectum that heals by itself in 3to 6 weeks  - Enlarged lymph nodes in the area of the sore    The bacteria continue to grow in the body, but there are few symptoms until the second stage.  Secondary syphilis symptoms may include:  - Skin rash, usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet  - Sores called mucous patches in or around the mouth, vagina, or penis  - Moist, warty patches (called condylomata lata) in the genitals or skin folds  - Fever  - General ill feeling  - Loss of appetite  - Muscle aches  - Joint pain  - Swollen lymph nodes  - Vision changes  - Hair loss    Symptoms of tertiary syphilis depend on which organs have been affected. They vary widely and can be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms include:  - Damage to the heart, causing aneurysms or valve disease  - Central nervous system disorders (neurosyphilis)  - Tumors of skin, bones, or liver)"
Do I need to see a doctor for Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)," If you suspect you have syphilis, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible for proper diagnosis and treatment. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, and it progresses through various stages if left untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent serious complications and potential long-term health problems. A doctor can perform tests to confirm the infection and prescribe appropriate antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria. Seeking medical attention promptly is essential to ensure effective management and prevent further transmission of the infection.","Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of syphilis.  Contact your doctor or nurse, or get screened in an STI clinic if you have:   - Had intimate contact with a person who has syphilis or any other STI  - Engaged in any high-risk sexual practices, including having multiple or unknown partners or using intravenous drugs)"
What is (are) Syphilis ?," Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It can be transmitted through sexual contact, including intercourse, oral sex, or anal sex, and can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Syphilis progresses through four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. The primary stage is characterized by the appearance of a painless sore at the site of infection, which usually develops within 10 to 90 days of exposure. The secondary stage is marked by a rash that appears on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, along with other symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. The latent stage can last for years without any symptoms, while the tertiary stage can cause damage to the heart, brain, eyes, and other organs. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics can cure syphilis and prevent serious complications.","Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. It infects the genital area, lips, mouth, or anus of both men and women. You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.    The early stage of syphilis usually causes a single, small, painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.    The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.    Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading syphilis.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)"
How to diagnose Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)," Syphilis, caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, can be diagnosed through various methods depending on the stage of infection. In the primary stage, a painless sore or chancre develops at the site of infection, usually the genitals, rectum, or mouth. The chancre typically appears 10-90 days after exposure and persists for 3-6 weeks. Diagnosis can be confirmed through a dark-field microscopy examination of fluid from the chancre, which allows visualization of the spirochetes. Alternatively, serologic tests such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test can be performed. These tests detect antibodies produced in response to the infection and are useful for screening and monitoring treatment progress.","The doctor or nurse will examine you. Tests that may be done include:  - Examination of fluid from sore  - Echocardiogram, aortic angiogram, and cardiac catheterization to look at the major blood vessels and the heart  - Spinal tap and examination of spinal fluid  - Blood tests to screen for syphillis bacteria (RPR, VDRL, or TRUST)    If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis:   - FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test)  - MHA-TP  - TP-EIA  - TP-PA)"
What are the treatments for Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)," The treatment of primary syphilis involves the use of antibiotics, specifically penicillin, which is the recommended first-line treatment. A single dose of penicillin is usually sufficient to cure primary syphilis if administered early in the course of the infection. In cases where penicillin cannot be used due to allergy or other reasons, alternative antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin, may be prescribed. Treatment is crucial to prevent the progression of the infection to secondary and later stages, which can cause more severe symptoms and long-term complications.","Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as:   - Doxycycline  - Penicillin G benzathine  - Tetracycline (for patients who are allergic to penicillin)    Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the patient's overall health.  To treat syphilis during pregnancy, penicillin is the drug of choice. Tetracycline cannot be used for treatment because it is dangerous to the unborn baby. Erythromycin may not prevent congenital syphilis in the baby. People who are allergic to penicillin should ideally be desensitized to it, and then treated with penicillin.  Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.  Symptoms and signs of this reaction include:  - Chills  - Fever  - General ill feeling (malaise)  - Headache  - Joint aches  - Muscle aches  - Nausea  - Rash    These symptoms usually disappear within 24 hours.  Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.  All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis is extremely contagious in the primary and secondary stages.)"
How to prevent Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)," **Preventing Syphilis - Primary:**

- Practice safe sex by using condoms during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
- Avoid contact with open sores or rashes on another person's body.
- Get tested for syphilis if you think you may have been exposed.
- If you are diagnosed with syphilis, complete the recommended treatment and notify your sexual partners so they can also get tested and treated if necessary.
- Avoid sharing sex toys or other personal items that could be contaminated with the bacteria that causes syphilis.","If you are sexually active, practice safe sex and always use a condom.  All pregnant women should be screened for syphilis.)"
Do you have information about CSF glucose test (Also called: Glucose test - CSF; Cerebrospinal fluid glucose test)," The CSF glucose test measures the amount of glucose (a type of sugar) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is used to help diagnose and monitor conditions that affect the central nervous system, such as meningitis, encephalitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Normal CSF glucose levels are between 50 and 80 mg/dL, and low levels may indicate an infection or other underlying medical condition. The test is performed by collecting a sample of CSF through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and sending it to a laboratory for analysis.","Summary : A CSF glucose test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that flows in the space surrounding the spinal cord and brain.

How the Test is Performed : A sample of CSF is needed. A lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, is the most common way to collect this sample. For information on this procedure, see the article on lumbar puncture.  Other methods for collecting CSF are rarely used, but may be recommended in some cases. They include:  - Cisternal puncture  - Ventricular puncture  - Removal of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain    The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.

Why the Test is Performed : This test may be done to diagnose:  - Tumors  - Infections  - Inflammation of the central nervous system  - Delirium  - Other neurological and medical conditions

Normal Results : The glucose level in the CSF should be 50 to 80 mg/100 mL (or greater than 2/3 of the blood sugar level).  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results include higher and lower glucose levels. Abnormal results may be due to:  - Infection (bacterial or fungus)  - Inflammation of the central nervous system  - Tumor)"
Do you have information about First aid kit," A first aid kit is a collection of supplies and equipment that are used to give medical treatment for minor injuries or illnesses. It is essential to have a first aid kit in the home, car, and workplace in order to be prepared for emergencies. The contents of a first aid kit can vary depending on the specific needs of the individual or group, but typically include items such as bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, tweezers, and a first aid manual. It is important to keep the first aid kit in a easily accessible location and to regularly check the contents to ensure they are still usable and in good condition.","Summary : You should make sure that you and your family are prepared to treat common symptoms, injuries, and emergencies. By planning ahead, you can create a well-stocked home first aid kit. Keep all of your supplies in one location so you know exactly where they are when you need them.  The following items are basic supplies. You can get most of them at a pharmacy or supermarket.  Bandages and dressings:  - Adhesive bandages (Band-Aid or similar brand); assorted sizes  - Aluminum finger splints  - Elastic (ACE) bandage for wrapping wrist, ankle, knee, and elbow injuries  - Eye shield, pads, and bandages  - Latex or non-latex gloves to reduce contamination risk  - Sterile gauze pads, non-stick (Adaptic-type, petrolatum or other) gauze and adhesive tape  - Triangular bandage for wrapping injuries and making an arm sling    Home health equipment:  - Blue ""baby bulb"" or ""turkey baster"" suction device  - Disposable, instant ice bags  - First-aid manual  - Hand sanitizer  - Latex or non-latex gloves to reduce contamination risk  - Save-A-Tooth storage device in case a tooth is broken or knocked out; contains a travel case and salt solution  - Sterile cotton balls  - Sterile cotton-tipped swabs  - Syringe, medicine cup, or medicine spoon for giving specific doses of medicine  - Thermometer  - Tweezers, to remove ticks and small splinters    Medicine for cuts and injuries:  - Antiseptic solution or wipes, such as hydrogen peroxide, povidone-iodine, or chlorhexidine  - Antibiotic ointment, such as bacitracin, polysporin, or mupirocin  - Sterile eyewash, such as contact lens saline solution  - Calamine lotion for stings or poison ivy  - Hydrocortisone cream, ointment, or lotion for itching    Be sure to check your kit regularly.

Do you have information about Glucagon blood test," The glucagon blood test measures the level of glucagon, a hormone produced by the pancreas, in the blood. Glucagon is responsible for raising blood sugar levels when they are low. The test is used to diagnose and monitor conditions that affect glucagon production, such as diabetes, hypoglycemia, and certain tumors of the pancreas. A blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm and sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results of the test are typically reported within a few days.","Summary : A glucagon blood test measures the amount of a hormone called glucagon in your blood. Glucagon is produced by cells in the pancreas. It helps control your blood sugar level by increasing blood sugar when it is too low.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your health care provider will tell you if you need to fast (not eat anything) for a period of time before the test.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : Glucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose. As the level of blood sugar decreases, the pancreas releases more glucagon. And as blood sugar increases, the pancreas releases less glucagon.   The provider may measure glucagon level if a person has symptoms of:  - Diabetes  - Glucagonoma (rare tumor of the pancreas) with symptoms of a skin rash called necrotizing migratory erythema, weight loss, mild diabetes, anemia, stomatitis, glossitis  - Growth hormone deficiency in children  - Liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver and poor liver function)  - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor)  - Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)

Normal Results : The normal range is 50 to 100 pg/mL.  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may indicate that the person may have a condition described above under Why the Test Is Performed.   Glucagon can be increased by prolonged fasting.

Risks : Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))"
What is (are) Glucose screening and tolerance tests during pregnancy ? (Also called: Oral glucose tolerance test - pregnancy (OGTT); Glucose challenge test - pregnancy)," During pregnancy, glucose screening and tolerance tests are performed to identify gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a condition characterized by high blood sugar levels that develops during pregnancy. The glucose challenge test, also known as the 50-gram glucose screening test, involves drinking a sugary drink and measuring blood sugar levels one hour later. If the results are abnormal, a glucose tolerance test is performed, where blood sugar levels are measured after fasting, and then two hours after drinking a larger amount of sugar. These tests help diagnose GDM, allowing for appropriate management and monitoring to ensure the health of both the mother and the baby.",A glucose screening test is a routine test during pregnancy that checks a pregnant womans blood glucose (sugar) level.  A glucose tolerance test is done if a glucose screening test result is higher than normal. It is used to diagnose gestational diabetes.  Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (diabetes) that starts or is found during pregnancy.)
What is (are) Glucose tolerance test - non-pregnant ? (Also called: Oral glucose tolerance test- non-pregnant; OGTT - non-pregnant; Diabetes - glucose tolerance test)," The glucose tolerance test (also called the oral glucose tolerance test or OGTT) is a medical test used to diagnose type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in non-pregnant individuals. The test involves measuring blood glucose levels before and after drinking a sugary drink, and it provides information about how the body processes glucose and responds to insulin.",The glucose tolerance test is a lab test to check how your body breaks down sugar.   Tests to screen for diabetes during pregnancy are done differently.)
Do you have information about Glucose urine test (Also called: Urine sugar test; Urine glucose test; Glucosuria test; Glycosuria test)," A Glucose urine test measures the amount of glucose (a type of sugar) in your urine. Normally, your kidneys filter glucose from your blood and reabsorb it back into your bloodstream. If your blood sugar levels are too high, your kidneys can't keep up with the filtering and some glucose ends up in your urine. A urine glucose test can help diagnose or monitor diabetes, a condition in which your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin properly, leading to high blood sugar levels. It can also help detect other medical conditions, such as kidney disease, liver disease, or an overactive thyroid gland. The test involves collecting a urine sample, usually first thing in the morning, and sending it to a laboratory for analysis.","Summary : The glucose urine test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in a urine sample. The presence of glucose in the urine is called glycosuria or glucosuria.  Glucose level can also be measured using a blood test or a cerebrospinal fluid test.

How the Test is Performed : After you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color the dipstick changes to tells the provider the level of glucose in your urine.   If needed,your provider may ask you to collect your urine at home over 24 hours. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.

How to Prepare for the Test : Certain medicinescan change the result of this test. Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking. Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.

How the Test will Feel : The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.

Why the Test is Performed : This test was commonly used to test for and monitor diabetes in the past. Now, blood tests to measure glucose level in the blood are easy to do and are used instead of the glucose urine test.  The glucose urine test may be ordered when the doctor suspects renal glycosuria. This is a rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when the blood glucose level is normal.

Normal Results : Glucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed.  Normal glucose range in urine: 0to 0.8 mmol/l (0to 15 mg/dL)  The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to yourhealth care providerabout the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Higher than normal levels of glucose may occur with:  - Diabetes: Small increases in urine glucose levels after a large meal are not always a cause for concern.    - Pregnancy: Up to half of women have glucose in their urine at sometime during pregnancy. Glucose in the urine may mean that a woman has gestational diabetes.  - Renal glycosuria: A rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when blood glucose levelsare normal.

Risks : There are no risks with this test.)"
What is (are) Prediabetes ? (Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes)," Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. It is a warning sign that you are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Prediabetes can be caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, lifestyle choices, and certain medical conditions. Some people with prediabetes may not have any symptoms, while others may experience increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision. Treatment for prediabetes typically includes lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. In some cases, medication may also be necessary to help control blood sugar levels.","Prediabetes occurs when the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood is too high, but not high enough to be called diabetes.   If you have prediabetes, you are at a much higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years. It also greatly increases your risk for heart disease.   Losing extra weight and getting regular exercise CAN stop prediabetes from becoming full-blown diabetes.)"
What is (are) Prediabetes ? (Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes)," Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. It is also known as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. People with prediabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Treatment for prediabetes typically includes diet and lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. Medications may also be prescribed to help control blood sugar levels.","Your body gets energy from the glucose in your blood. A hormone called insulin helps the cells in your body use glucose. If you have prediabetes, this process does not work as well. Glucose builds up in your bloodstream. If the levels get high enough, you can develop type 2 diabetes.  Having diabetes increases the risk for certain health problems. This is because high glucose levels in the blood can damage the blood vessels and nerves. This can lead to heart disease and stroke. If you have prediabetes, damage may already be occurring in your blood vessels.   Having prediabetes is a wake-up call to take action to improve your health.)"
How to prevent Prediabetes ? (Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes)," Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be considered diabetes.  It is important to take action to prevent or manage prediabetes to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems. Here are some tips to help prevent prediabetes:  Eat a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; Choose lean protein sources;  limit unhealthy fats, added sugars, and salt; Be physically active for at least 30 minutes most days of the week;  Aim for a healthy weight; Quit smoking;   Manage stress levels; Get enough sleep;  and Have regular check-ups with your doctor.","Your health care provider will talk with you about your condition and your risks from prediabetes. To help you prevent diabetes, your provider will likely suggest certain lifestyle changes:  Eat healthy foods: This includes whole grains, lean proteins, low-fat dairy, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Watch portion sizes, and avoid sweets and fried foods.   Lose weight: Just a small weight loss can make a big difference in your health. For example, your provider may suggest that you lose about 7% of your body weight. So, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose about 14 pounds. Your provider may suggest a diet or you can join a program to help you lose weight.  Get more exercise: Aim to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate exercise at least 5 days a week. This can include brisk walking, riding your bike, or swimming. You can also break up exercise into smaller sessions throughout the day.  Take medicines as directed: Depending on your other risk factors, your provider may prescribe medicines to lower cholesterol or blood pressure or to help prevent diabetes.)"
What is (are) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ? (Also called: Deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; G6PD Deficiency; G6PDD; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency)," Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an inherited condition in which the body lacks or has little of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This enzyme helps red blood cells function properly by protecting them from oxidative damage. Without enough G6PD, red blood cells can break down prematurely, leading to a condition called hemolytic anemia. G6PD deficiency is the most common enzyme defect causing hemolytic anemia and affects around 400 million people worldwide, particularly those of African, Mediterranean, and Asian descent. The severity of the condition can vary widely, ranging from mild to severe, and symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, jaundice, dark urine, and pale skin.","Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that occurs most often in males. This condition mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. This destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.  The most common medical problem associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria). Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (a reaction called favism).  Glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. Many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms.)"
Do you have information about Blood Sugar (Also called: Blood glucose)," Blood sugar, also known as blood glucose, is a vital energy source for cells throughout the body. It is derived from the food we eat and is regulated by the hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas. Insulin allows glucose to enter cells for energy production or storage. High blood sugar levels, a condition known as hyperglycemia, can occur due to insulin resistance or lack of insulin, leading to various complications such as diabetes. Conversely, low blood sugar, called hypoglycemia, can result from excessive insulin or certain medications, causing symptoms like shakiness, sweating, and dizziness. Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is crucial for overall well-being and preventing long-term health problems.","Summary : Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food you eat, and is your body's main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy.    Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. Even if you don't have diabetes, sometimes you may have problems with blood sugar that is too low or too high. Keeping a regular schedule of eating, activity, and taking any medicines you need can help.    If you do have diabetes, it is very important to keep your blood sugar numbers in your target range. You may need to check your blood sugar several times each day. Your health care provider will also do a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood sugar level over the past three months. If your blood sugar is too high, you may need to take medicines and/or follow a special diet.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)"
Who should get Glucagon and why is it prescribed ?," Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar levels. It is prescribed for people with diabetes who experience severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and are unable to take glucose or eat carbohydrates by mouth. Glucagon is given as an injection, and it works by stimulating the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream. People with diabetes may be prescribed glucagon as a rescue medication to carry with them in case of severe hypoglycemia.",Glucagon is a hormone produced in the pancreas. Glucagon is used to raise very low blood sugar. Glucagon is also used in diagnostic testing of the stomach and other digestive organs.  This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.)
